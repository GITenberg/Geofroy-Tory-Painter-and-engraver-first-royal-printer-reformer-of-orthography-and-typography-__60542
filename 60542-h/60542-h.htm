<p><span class="figleft200">
<img src="images/i_a_005_b.jpg" width="200" height="236" alt="B" /></span>ERNARD'S <em>monograph on Tory was first
published in </em>1857, <em>when M. Bernard was
already a recognized authority on the history
of typography. In</em> 1865, <em>after an interval
devoted largely to a search for further
information concerning Tory</em>, <em>and for probable
examples of his work as an artist</em>, <em>a
second edition of the book appeared</em>, <em>enlarged
by more than one-half</em>, <em>arranged more systematically</em>,
<em>and embellished with several
additional engravings of designs which are</em>, <em>in the author's opinion</em>, <em>attributable
to Tory. The Iconography, which forms the third part of this
revised edition, did not appear as such in the first edition, although a
small part of the material it contains may be found scattered through
that edition. It now occupies more space than the Biography and Bibliography
combined. The new arrangement necessitated more or less repetition
where, as in many instances, the same book is referred to by M.
Bernard in more than one section of his work; and this repetition sometimes
reveals discrepancies between the different descriptions. Where
such discrepancies have been discovered by him the translator has endeavoured
to correct them, generally, in the absence of an opportunity
to inspect the volume in question, assuming that the description in the
bibliographical section is more likely to be trustworthy; in a number of
cases, however, inspection of title-pages themselves, or of reproductions
thereof, has enabled him to correct numerous minor errors in transcription.</em></p>

<p><em>The kindness of the late Mr. Amor L. Hollingsworth, in lending his
fine copy of the first edition of 'Champ fleury,' made it possible to collate
therewith M. Bernard's numerous extracts from that rare and interesting
book, and to ensure entire accuracy with respect to them.</em></p>

<p><em>As M. Bernard writes certain printers' names in different ways, the
translator has assumed that the names are printed differently in different
books, and has not attempted to make them uniform. Such names
are Dubois</em> (<em>Du Bois</em>), <em>Lecoq</em> (<em>Le Coq</em>), <em>Galliot</em> (<em>Galiot</em>). <em>The few notes
supplied by the translator are inserted in square brackets.</em></p>

<p><em>The translations of Tory's various Latin effusions, including the complete
text of the little brochure called forth by the death of his daughter
Agnes, were made by Mr. J. W. H. Walden of Cambridge. The Latin
originals will be found at the end of the book, in Appendix X.</em></p>

<p><em>Since such authorities as M. Bernard and M. Renouvier differ as to
the ascription to Tory of many of the designs mentioned in this work, it
seemed the wiser course to choose for illustration only such subjects as are
described by the author, without questioning the soundness of his reasoning
or the infallibility of his deductions. The only exception is the beautiful
design reproduced on the first page of the Index. This is taken from
Robert Estienne's folio New Testament</em> (<em>in Greek</em>) <em>of</em> 1550, <em>where</em>, <em>with
two other similar decorations</em>, <em>it occurs in conjunction with the friezes
and floriated Greek letters reproduced elsewhere in this volume</em>. <em>They are
unsigned, but all are indubitably from the same hand. Although they are
not mentioned by M. Bernard, it seems incredible that he should never
have seen them.</em></p>

<p><em>The printer of this volume has had more than ordinary good fortune
in literally stumbling upon most of the designs here reproduced. The pressure
of other work has prohibited systematic research, and the originals
of these illustrations were nearly all discovered while he was engaged
upon other matters. Many were found in the Harvard Library, some in
the reference library of the Riverside Press, some in auction rooms, and
some in booksellers' catalogues. The only exception is the series of borders
from the Hours of</em> 1524-25, <em>which were expressly photographed from
the copy in the library of the British Museum.</em></p>

<p><em>That so much has come to hand in so haphazard a way is but an additional
proof of Tory's industry and versatility. There seems to be almost
no limit to the work which may fairly be credited to him, and M. Bernard
hardly exaggerated when he said that there was scarcely an illustrated
volume of any importance issued in Paris during the first half of
the</em> XVI <em>th century in which the artist of the Lorraine cross did not have
a hand</em>.<em> Hours and Classics, Bibles and Testaments, Mathematical and
Medical works&mdash;all bear evidence to his prolific pen and graver, and
were time disregarded, the preparation of this volume might be almost indefinitely
prolonged. Incomplete as it is, however, it is hoped that it will
measurably fulfill the desire expressed by Mr. A. W. Pollard nearly fifteen
years ago, in the first issue of 'Bibliographica.' Speaking of Bernard's
monograph</em>, <em>he said</em>, '<em>It would be pleasant if some French publisher
would bring out a new edition worthily illustrated</em>, <em>for in</em> 1865 <em>the modern
processes of reproduction were not yet invented</em>, <em>and the few and poor
woodcuts in M. Bernard's book give no just idea of the artistic powers
of Tory</em>, <em>whose illustrated editions are so difficult to meet with that M.
Bernard's admirable commentary loses half its value for lack of a proper
accompaniment of text.'</em></p>

<p><em>A word regarding the method of reproduction of these illustrations
may not be out of place here. More was aimed at than mere photographic
copies, which are in many ways inadequate. It was thought desirable to
make the decorations an integral part of the typographic treatment of
the volume and to preserve when practicable their original relations to
the type. To attain this end, more perfect printing plates were necessary
than could be obtained directly from the old editions. The designs, therefore,
were all redrawn with the greatest care over photographs of the
originals, and from these drawings photo-engravings made, which were
afterward perfected by hand when the forms were on the press.</em></p>

<p><em>Notwithstanding some inevitable slight divergences of line, this
method preserves with far greater faithfulness the spirit and effect of the
original prints, and the result is more truly a facsimile than a direct photographic
copy would have been. Both drawing and engraving of Tory's
designs were exquisite, and as a rule they were beautifully printed, especially
by Colines and Robert Estienne. Some of them, however, suffered
at the hands of inferior printers. Imperfections and irregularities due to
the carelessness or unskilfullness of the printer are readily discernible,
and in the reproductions in this volume have been eliminated. The preservation,
by this treatment, of more of the beauty and interest of the originals
is sufficient justification for departing to this extent from the usual
methods of facsimile reproduction.</em></p>

<p><em>Following the French fashion, the Table of Contents and List of
Illustrations are printed at the end of the volume.</em></p>

SECOND EDITION.</h2>


<p><span class="figleft150"><img src="images/i_a_010_t.jpg" width="150" height="145" alt="T" /></span>HE first half of the
sixteenth century was
with respect to printing
(as with respect to
the other arts) a period
of renovation, not in
the matter of processes
of execution, which remained about the
same as in the fifteenth century, but in the
matter of the make-up of books, which was
entirely revolutionized. Typographical arrangement,
appearance of the letters and
ornaments, everything, even to the cover,
was changed almost at the same time, or, at
all events, within a very few years. At that
time printing gave over the servile copying
of manuscripts, which had at first served it
as models, and adopted special rules, better
adapted to its method of execution. For instance,
it relegated notes to the foot of the
pages, calling attention to them by marks of
reference, instead of placing them at the
side of the text, as had previously been the
custom, at the cost of an enormous amount
of labour, without benefit to the reader. It
also abandoned the use of red capitals,<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
which, by increasing the labour twofold,
made books expensive, and replaced them
by floriated letters, which were quite as distinctive,
but were set up and printed with
the text. This style of ornament, so favourable
to artistic results, developed rapidly,
and soon extended from the letters to the
illustrations, which began to be introduced
in books in constantly increasing numbers.
Under the general impulsion of the Renaissance,
engraving was transformed: instead
of the coarse woodcuts, of the so-called criblé
style, in which the background was black
sprinkled with white dots,<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> and the design
stamped in white, as with a punch, engraving in relief came into
vogue, just as we have it to-day, identical in
form, although the processes have been perfected. A similar revolution
took place in the matter of letters: the gothic or semi-gothic characters,
which had hitherto been used, were replaced by roman characters of a novel
shape, borrowed from the monuments of antiquity (then studied with great
ardour), which continued in use until the Revolution. Lastly, the covers
of books also underwent a transformation brought about by the force of
events: the parchment rolls used by the ancients had been succeeded,
during the Middle Ages, by bound volumes, of a shape more convenient
for reading; these volumes, of which those who were fortunate enough to
own any never owned more than a very small number, being intended to be
arranged on the library shelves in such wise as to present one side to
the visitor's eye, were adorned with numerous ornaments of various sorts
on that side, so that they could easily be distinguished.
Later, these ornaments were omitted and the title of the book substituted,
in huge black or gauffered letters. But the invention of printing soon
caused that device to be abandoned. As the increasing numbers of books
made it impossible to give up so much space to them, they were arranged
side by side on the shelves, care being taken to print the title in gold
letters (so that it might be more legible) on the back of the book, which
was the only part of it in sight. This innovation compelled the doing away
with raised decorations, especially those in precious stones or in metal,
which would have torn the books that stood next them. Thereafter leather
binding came into general use; the gauffering on the sides was continued
for some time; but in the sixteenth century this in turn was replaced by
gold tooling 'à filet,' and the transformation was complete.</p>

<p><span class="drop-cap">T</span>HE man who contributed most largely
to the threefold evolution I have
described was Geofroy Tory, a man who is
hardly known to-day,<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> despite all his talents,
although he received in 1530, as reward of
his labours, the title of king's printer, which
François I had never before bestowed upon
any one. I say that Tory is hardly known to-day;
in truth, it is, in his case, equivalent
to being unknown, to be known, as he is,
only as a publisher. Some few scholars, to
be sure, are aware that he was a printer; but
the fact is so little known that his biographer
has denied it.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> As for his noblest title
to fame, that of engraver, nobody is aware
of it; and yet we owe to Tory the resuscitation
of engraving in France. As the historian
of typography,<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> I have thought that
it was for me to describe with special care
one of the fairest jewels in his crown. Such
is the purpose of the work here presented,
wherein will also be found, in connection
with the honour paid to Tory by François
I, some information concerning the first
royal printers, and a list of those officers
from the beginning down to the extinction
of the office in 1830, three centuries, year
for year, after its creation. François I is, in
truth, entitled to be considered the creator
of the office of king's printer, for prior to
his reign we find but one typographer who
bore that title, while, from François I down,
the series of king's printers was not again
interrupted. The appointment of Pierre le
Rouge, on whom the title was bestowed in
1488,<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> may be creditable to Charles VIII,
but it was without result. The honour of
having made of the eminently literary post
of king's printer a permanent office reverts
of right and naturally to the prince who has
been called the Father of Letters. In truth
that prince, as we shall see hereafter, was not
content with a single printer; he had several
at once, with distinct functions, and appointed
successors without loss of time to
such as retired or died during his lifetime.</p>

<p>But, I repeat, the principal purpose of my
work is to make Tory known as one of the
most skilful engravers we have ever had.
Of course I cannot forget that he was the
learned editor of the 'Cosmographie du
Pape Pie II,' the 'Itinéraire Antonin,' etc.;
the publisher, of rare taste, who put forth
the Hours of 1525, 1527, etc.; the accomplished
printer of the 'Sacre de la Reine
Eléonore,' and the distinguished philologist
of 'Champ fleury,' to whom, as we shall see,
we owe the invention of the orthographic
forms peculiar to the French language.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> But
what has especially attracted me in Tory is
his work as an engraver. In that rôle he was
without predecessor or rival, for those persons
who may be represented as such may
have been his pupils, nothing more. Jean
Duvet alone might quarrel with this limitation;
but, although he was Tory's contemporary,
he was not his teacher; for Tory
had gone for his schooling in the art to the
very fountain-head, to Italy, before Duvet
produced anything. As for Jean Cousin, de
Laulne, du Cerceau, Léonard Gauthier, and
the rest, they did not come until after Tory.
The honour of revivifying the art of engraving
in France belongs to Tory alone, bestriding
two centuries, the fifteenth and
sixteenth; indeed, some of his productions are
pure gothic. This I propose to demonstrate
in the third part of my book, after I have,
in the first part, narrated the general facts
of our artist's life, in which we may observe
also the development of a revolution in the
matter of philology; for Tory was a devoted
partisan of the classic tongues before he became
one of the sturdiest champions of the
French language.</p>

<p>In order to emphasize the importance of
the orthographic reform achieved by Tory,
I have usually followed the orthography of
the time in my quotations from ancient
works. It is an anachronism, to be sure, but
it is of no consequence when the reader is
forewarned.

I have also felt at liberty to correct
now and then, without calling attention
to them, the typographical errors found
in the texts quoted.</p>

<p>I will not conclude without thanking publicly
those persons who have kindly assisted
me in my researches concerning Tory. I
have had occasion to mention their names
in the course of my work, but that is not
enough: I beg them to accept in this place
the assurance of my gratitude. There are two
to whom I am especially grateful, for they
have considerably augmented my store of
documents: they are MM. Achille Devéria<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
and Olivier Barbier, of the Bibliothèque Impériale:
it is owing to their kind communications
to me that the list of Tory's artistic
works will be found not far from complete.</p>

REFORMER OF ORTHOGRAPHY AND TYPOGRAPHY
UNDER FRANÇOIS I.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="figleft200"><img src="images/i_b_001_l.jpg" width="200" height="196" alt="L" /></span>ESS than twenty years after the introduction
of printing at Paris, there was born
at Bourges a child of the people, destined
to impart to French typography a vigorous
artistic impulsion, or, to speak more
accurately, to work therein a genuine
revolution. Geofroy Tory<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> was born in the
capital of Berry, about 1480, of obscure,
middle-class parents, as he himself tells
us.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> Everything seems to indicate that he
first saw the light of day in the faubourg of Saint-Privé, to this day the
abode of humble vine-dressers. How, in that most lowly condition of
life, he succeeded in acquiring the degree of education which he afterward
exhibited, it is hard to say. However, it is proper to remember that
Bourges was at that time a metropolitan and university city, where there
were several schools, both ecclesiastic and lay. We may well believe
that, having, at an early age, aroused the interest of some patron by
virtue of his fortunate natural endowments and his intelligence, he was
admitted to the schools attached to the chapter, where he learned the
first elements of grammar. We shall soon find him dedicating the first
fruits of his labours to a canon of the metropolitan church of Bourges,
who seems to have been, at that time, his Mæcenas.</p>

<p>Once master of the first rudiments of grammar, Tory perfected himself
by following the curriculum of the university, where, as we learn
from himself, he had for his teacher a Fleming named Guillaume de
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>Ricke, otherwise called 'le Riche' in French and 'Dives' in Latin; and
for a fellow disciple under this Ghent-born master, a certain Herverus
de Berna, from Saint-Amand, who afterward wrote a panegyric of the
Comtes de Nevers.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>Tory then went, to finish his literary education, to Italy, whither he
betook himself early in the sixteenth century. He sojourned principally
in Rome, where he attended most frequently the famous college called
La Sapienza,<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> and in Bologna, where he attended the lectures of the
celebrated Filippo Beroaldo, who died in 1505.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> Tory returned to France
a little before that event, and established his domicile in Paris, which
he always loved henceforward as one loves one's native city,<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> and where
he began his literary career.</p>

<p>The first work of his of which we have any knowledge is an edition
of Pomponius Mela, which he prepared for the bookseller Jean Petit;
it was printed by Gilles de Gourmont because it required the use of
some Greek type.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> This book was dedicated by Tory to his compatriot
Philibert Babou, at that time valet de chambre to the king. The dedicatory
epistle is dated Paris, the VI<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> of the Nones of December, 1507;
but the printing of the book was not completed until January 10, 1508
(new style).<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> Several articles in this volume, which were written by
Tory, are signed by the word <span class="smcapa">CIVIS</span>, which he had adopted for his device.
That patriotic designation was well suited to a descendant of those
Bituriges who strove vainly at Avaricum<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> to defend the autonomy of
Gaul against Cæsar. In any event it is interesting to find, three hundred
years before Jean-Jacques Rousseau, a man, justly proud of his learning,
which he owed entirely to himself, clothing himself in that title of
citizen, which was formerly held in such honour in the provincial
cities, and especially in Bourges, whose name Tory never fails to append
to his own: 'Geofroy Tory de Bourges.'</p>

<p>This erudite production and the patronage of Philibert Babou were
perhaps responsible for Tory's appointment to the office of regent, otherwise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
called professor, of the College of Plessis, where we find him installed
in 1509. It was there that he edited for the first Henri Estienne
the 'Cosmographie du pape Pie II.'<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p>The dedication of this book, addressed by Tory to Germain de Gannay,
canon of the metropolitan church of Bourges, and recently appointed
Bishop of Cahors by King Louis XII,<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> was dated at the College of Plessis,
on the VI of the Nones of October,<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> 1509. Tory's edition (the third
according to him) contains forty-one quarto sheets of text, and is accompanied
by a map of the old world. The 'avis au lecteur,' also written by
Tory, is signed, according to his custom, with the word <span class="smcapa">CIVIS</span>. In the
following year, in collaboration with a compatriot and fellow pupil,
Herverus de Berna, Tory published a short Latin poem on the Passion,
written by his former teacher, Guillaume de Ricke. In this wise he acquitted
his debt of gratitude.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> Shortly after, Tory published for the Marnef
brothers an edition of Berosus, who was then much in vogue, thanks
to the fabrications of Annius of Viterbo. This book, the preface of which
is dated May 9, 1510, went to no less than three editions, to say nothing
of those issued by other publishers.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p>In the same year Tory published for the same booksellers a small
volume of miscellanies, under this title: 'Valerii Probi grammatici de
interpretandis Romanorum literis opusculum, cum aliis quibusdam scitu
dignissimis.' It was probably printed by Gilles de Gourmont, for we find
in it his unaccented Greek type.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> This volume, which contains twelve
octavo sheets, has two engravings on wood&mdash;the mark of the booksellers
on the title-page, and a Roman portico a little farther on. There are
also a few small cuts engraved on metal in one of the articles. The dedicatory
epistle, dated at the College of Plessis the VI of the Ides of May
(May 10), 1510, and addressed by Tory to two compatriots, who had
probably been his fellow pupils, is signed by his device, the word <span class="smcapa">CIVIS</span>.
The dedication begins thus: 'Godofredus Torinus Bituricus ornatissimos
Philibertum Baboum et Ioannem Alemanum Iuniorem, cives Bituricos,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
pari inter se amicitia conjunctissimos, salutat.' Babou and Lallemant were
at this time two important personages in Bourges: the former was secretary
and silversmith to the king, the other, mayor of the city. We see that
Tory had acquired valuable connections in his native place, despite his
modest origin. Among the extracts from ancient authors in this book he
interspersed several pieces of verse of his own composition.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p>Finally, in the same year, Tory issued an edition of Quintilian's 'Institutiones,'
carefully collated by him with several manuscripts. This
work was undertaken at the request of Jean Rousselet, Seigneur de La
Part-Dieu, near Lyon, and an ancestor of Château-Regnaud, Maréchal
de France. This Rousselet, who died in 1520, belonged to one of the
wealthy Lombard families which had settled at Lyon long before; they
made, as we see, a noble use of their wealth. His real name was Ruccelli.
He had married a young gentlewoman of Bourges, Jeanne Lallemant,
daughter of Jean Lallemant, Seigneur de Marmagne, a school friend of
Tory, whom I have already had occasion to mention. Doubtless it was
this connection which brought Tory into relations with Rousselet. The
text is preceded by the following dedicatory letter:</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="center"><em>Geofroy Tory of Bourges to Jean Rousselet, devoted lover of letters,
long life and happiness.</em></p>

<p>Never, I think, most illustrious Jean, will you omit or cease to have
the aspiration of nobly justifying, both by your character and by your
good deeds, the great hopes which your relatives and your country have
of you. That you might benefit the State by your counsel also, you made
it your interest that I should emend Quintilian and have him printed
as handsomely as might be. After carefully collating a large number of
manuscripts, I industriously set to work and, by eliminating almost countless
errors, I made a single manuscript of considerable accuracy. This, in
accordance with your orders, I sent from Paris to Lyon. I only hope that
the printers will not introduce other, new, errors. Farewell, and love me.</p>

<p>Paris, at the College of Plessis, the third of the Calends of March.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>This book, which forms a large octavo volume, unpaged, printed in
italic type, and in which we find some most attractive Greek type, with
accents, was finished on the VII of the Calends of July (that is to say,
June 25), 1510. The printer's name does not anywhere appear, and the
place of printing (Lyon) is mentioned only in Tory's letter.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<p>I know of nothing of Tory's dated in 1511<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>; but that does not prove
that he produced nothing in that year, for it is certain that about that
time he published several works which have not come down to us. In
fact, he tells us in his 'Champ fleury'<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> that he has 'caused to be printed
and put before the eyes of worthy scholars divers little works in Latin,
both in verse and in prose.' Now we know of nothing of his in verse
prior to 1524, except what we find at the end of the 'Valerius Probus'
of 1510, and of Guillaume de Ricke's 'Passion.' Moreover, the absence
of any publication by Tory in 1511 may be explained by the confusion
incident to his retirement from the College of Plessis and his installation
at the College Coqueret, which seems to have taken place in that year,
but concerning which I have no other information than the imprint on
two books published by him in the following year.</p>

<p>The first work edited by Tory in 1512 was an architectural treatise
entitled: 'Leonis Baptistæ Alberti Florentini.&mdash;Libri de re ædificatoria
decem,' etc.; a quarto volume of 14 preliminary leaves and 174 leaves
of text. This book was printed by Berthold Rembolt (whose mark it
bears on the first page), at the joint expense of that printer and the
bookseller Louis Hornken, whose mark is at the end of the book. The
dedication, which is addressed to Philibert Babou, and dated at the College
Coqueret on the XV of the Calends of September (August 18),
1512, informs us that Tory received the manuscript of the book from
his friend Robert Dure,<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> principal of the College of Plessis, who gave
it to him four years earlier, when Tory himself was professor at the
same college. As always, this dedication is signed <span class="smcapa">CIVIS</span>. A note on the
last page but one informs us that the printing was finished on August
23, 1512.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p>The second work put forth by Tory in 1512 was the 'Itinerarium Antonini.'
It was the second book that he prepared for Henri Estienne, in
whose establishment it has been said<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> (erroneously, I think) that he filled
the post of corrector of the press. However that may be, the dedication,
addressed by Tory to Philibert Babou, is dated at the College Coqueret
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>the XIV of the Calends of September (August 19), 1512. Tory says to
Babou that he had dispatched a copy of the manuscript of this book to
him at Tours four years before (that is to say, in 1508), but that the person
to whom it was entrusted for delivery to him had given it, in his own
name, to somebody else. This time, in order not to be defrauded of the
fruits of his labours, he had caused the work to be printed from his own
copy, having carefully collated it with a manuscript lent him by Christophe
de Longueil.<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> The volume is a sexto-decimo, remarkable for the
beauty of its execution. The copy in vellum which I have seen at the Bibliothèque
Nationale is still redolent of the fifteenth century. We find in
it certain verses of the Burgundian Gérard de Vercel in honour of Tory,
which prove that the latter was even then in
some repute as a scholar, and as a printer,
too; for the author contrasts him with the
wretched printers of the day. The preliminary
matter, by Geofroy Tory, is signed by
the word <span class="smcapa">CIVIS</span>, printed in red. At the end
of the volume the same word reappears in a
very curious monogram composed of the letters
CIVS so arranged that we can read the
word <span class="smcapa">CIVIS</span> in all directions. Therein we may
detect thus early Tory's taste for ciphers and devices, a taste to which he
afterward gave free rein, in his 'Champ fleury.'</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 200px;">
<img src="images/i_b_006.jpg" width="200" height="226" alt="" />
</div>

<p>At this epoch occurs a momentous event in Geofroy Tory's life. On
August 26, 1512, he became the father of a daughter, who was christened
Agnes. I do not know the date of his marriage, but it was at least
as early as 1511. A document of much later date, to which we shall have
occasion to refer hereafter, informs us that his child's mother was named
Perrette le Hullin. There is reason to believe that she, like her husband,
was of Bourges, as the name of Hullin was common there at that time.
Soon after the birth of Agnes, perhaps just at the opening of the term
of 1512, Tory entered the College of Bourgogne as regent, or professor
of philosophy. His lectures, which were continued for several years, were
attended by a large number of hearers, if we may believe a poetical epitaph
composed in laudation of him and published by La Caille.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> Tory
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>himself seems to refer to this professorship in his 'Champ fleury,'<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> but
I have been unable to find any record of it, because, presumably, the new
direction in which he was then turning his faculties required a certain
time of preparation.</p>

<p>This is what happened: Tory, whose activity was very great, did not
confine himself to his professorship,<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> but set about learning drawing
(probably under the instruction of Jean Perreal, of whom I shall have
occasion to speak again), and also engraving, for which he had a special
bent. This apprenticeship, with the duties of his professor's chair,&mdash;for
Tory drove art and philosophy side by side, as the epitaph just quoted
has it ('philosophiam simulque artem exercuit typographicam'),<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>&mdash;engrossed
him completely for three or four years; but at the end of that
time, being far from content with his attempts at printing and engraving,
or too enthusiastic to be satisfied with a partial result, he determined to
study classic forms and outlines in Italy itself, of which country he had
retained such agreeable memories that he speaks of it constantly. Consequently
he abandoned his professorship and started south again. It was
on this journey that he visited the Coliseum 'more than a thousand
times,'<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> that he saw the theatre of Orange,<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> and the ancient monuments
of Languedoc<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> and of other places in France and Italy,<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> which he cites
as his authorities on every page of his 'Champ fleury.'</p>

<p>Tory does not give the precise date of this artistic journey; but it is
established by a passage in his book, where he informs us that he saw
the 'Epitaphs of Ancient Rome' printed in that city.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> Now this book
of Epitaphs can be no other than the collection published by the celebrated
printer Mazochi, under the title: 'Epigrammata sive inscriptiones
antiquæ urbis,' folio, dated 1516, but preceded by a license from the
Pope, of 1517.<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> This hint of Tory's is doubly valuable to us, for it not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
only tells us the date of our artist's second journey to Italy, but reveals
his predilection for typography. As we see, he was already studying the
printing art with interest.</p>

<p>On his return to Paris, about 1518, Tory, who was not a wealthy man,
was obliged to think about turning his talents to account, in order to
earn his living. His principal resource seems to have been the painting
of manuscripts, otherwise called miniature; but, whether because he did
not find sufficient work of that sort, or because he considered another
branch of art more useful, he soon gave his entire attention to engraving
on wood, in which he speedily acquired considerable celebrity. About
the same time, Tory also joined the fraternity of booksellers, following
a custom then quite general among engravers,&mdash;a custom which their
predecessors, the miniaturists, had handed down to them, and which was
continued down to the eighteenth century.<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> In truth, it was not unnatural
that those who decorated books should sell them, or, if you prefer,
that those who sold them should decorate them. It was one way of earning
more money. Desiring to signalize his début in the career of a bibliopole
in a noteworthy way, Tory undertook to engrave for himself a
series of borders 'à l'antique,' which he intended for a book of Hours,&mdash;a
sort of book that was very profitable at that time, because of the
great amount of work which it required; but the task was a long one,
and he was obliged to work for different printers in the mean time. One
of the first who employed him was Simon de Colines. Colines, who became
a printer in 1520, as a result of his marriage to Henri Estienne's
widow, commissioned Tory to design marks, floriated letters, and borders
for the books that he published in his own name; he also entrusted him,
I think, with the engraving of his italic type, which he soon began to use
in conjunction with the roman type that he had from his predecessor.</p>

<p>But Tory's active mind could not be content with a single occupation.
He was a patriot first of all, as his device proves. And so, far from allowing
himself to be engrossed by his memories of the literary and artistic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
treasures of Italy, he began to study with ardour the monuments of his
mother tongue, not only in those books printed in French&mdash;very few as
yet&mdash;which he had at hand in his shop, but also, and especially, in divers
fine manuscripts on parchment confided to him by 'his good friend and
brother, René Massé, of Vendôme, chronicler to the king,' whose merits,
entirely forgotten in our day,<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> he warmly extols.<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p>

<p>Now, while studying that same French tongue, so decried by the
scholars of his time, Tory discovered therein beauties which required
only a little cultivation to make of it the finest language in the world.
From that moment our Berrichon, hitherto a partisan of the classics,
shook off entirely the yoke of Greek and Latin, and thought only of the
means of making French take precedence everywhere.</p>

<p>'I see,' he says, 'some who choose to write in Greek and in Latin,
and yet cannot speak French well.... To me it seems, with submission,
that it would better beseem a Frenchman to write in French than in another
tongue, as well for the profit of his said French tongue, as to adorn
his nation and enrich his native language, which is as fair and fine [belle
et bonne] as another when it is well set down in writing.... When I see
a Frenchman write in Greek or in Latin, I seem to see a mason clad in
philosopher's or king's garb, who would fain recite a mask on the stage
of La Baroche<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> or in the confraternity of La Trinité, and cannot pronounce
well enough, as having too thick a tongue; cannot bear himself
well, nor walk fittingly, insomuch as his legs and feet are unwonted to
the gait of philosopher or king. Who should see a Frenchman clad in the
native dress of a Lombard, which is most often long and scant, of blue
linen or of buckram, methinks that Frenchman would scarce jest at his
ease without soon slashing it and taking from it its true form as a Lombard
dress, which is but very rarely slashed, for Lombards do not often
work havoc with their belongings. However, I leave all this to the wise
guidance of learned men, and will not burden myself with Greek or
Latin save to cite them in due time and place, or to talk with such as
cannot speak French.'<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p>

<p>Tory had found his vocation at last. He resolved to establish the superiority
of his mother tongue in a special book, illustrated by engravings
by his own hand, and intended particularly for printers and booksellers,
who were in a position to distribute it so rapidly with the aid of their
connections.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>But while he was engaged in his studies, a terrible catastrophe fell
upon him without warning, and caused him to forget his new projects
for some time. His daughter Agnes, of whom he had conceived the most
brilliant hopes, was taken from him on August 25, 1522, at the age of
nine years eleven months and thirty days, that is to say, ten years less one
day. Entirely absorbed by his grief, Tory wrote a short Latin poem upon
the sad event. This poem, dedicated, like most of his other books, to
Philibert Babou, was not published until February 15, 1523 (1524, new
style). In this little work, consisting of two quarto sheets, are contained
some most interesting details of Tory's life. We learn here, for example,
that he had grounded his daughter Agnes, young as she was, in Latin and
the fine arts.</p>

<p>'Desiring to instruct me in the Ausonian tongue, and also to render
me accomplished in the polite arts, he, like a most affectionate father,
teaching me night and day, himself laid the foundations, sweet and
ample, for my life.'<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></p>

<p>Farther on, he makes his daughter speak thus, from the depths of
the urn in which she is supposed to repose:&mdash;</p>


<blockquote><p class="center">MONITOR</p>

<p>Who made for you this urn set with brilliant gems?</p>

<p class="center">AGNES</p>

<p>Who? My father, famed in this art.</p>

<p class="center">MONITOR</p>

<p>Your father is certainly an excellent potter.</p>

<p class="center">AGNES</p>

<p>He practises industriously every day the liberal arts.</p>

<p class="center">MONITOR</p>

<p>Does he also write melodies and poems?</p>

<p class="center">AGNES</p>

<p>He does. He also blesses with sweet words this lot of mine.</p>

<p class="center">MONITOR</p>

<p>Yes, the skill of the man is wonderful.</p>

<p class="center">AGNES</p>

<p>Hardly has any land produced so famous a man.<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>We learn from this that Tory was not only a scholar, which we already
knew, but an artist of great merit. Who knows? it may be that we had in
him the making of a Benvenuto Cellini. What more was necessary that he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>should reveal himself as such? Very little&mdash;perhaps the falling in with
a wealthy Mæcenas. In fact, we find these lines in another piece of verse
in the same collection:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="center">WAYFARER</p>

<p>He is certainly well deserving of some Mæcenas.</p>

<p class="center">GENIUS</p>

<p>Few are the Mæcenases who live in the French world. No one to-day
either encourages the liberal arts by appropriate gifts or undertakes to
encourage them in any way. Uprightness and fair virtue are in no esteem.
So powerful is the sway of unhappy Avarice. Treachery, deceit, and vice
are in the ascendant. Virtues are put in the background, and every form
of wretched evil creeps abroad.</p>

<p class="center">WAYFARER</p>

<p>What, therefore, does he who is trained by the charming Muses?</p>

<p class="center">GENIUS</p>

<p>He takes pleasure in being able to live in his own house.</p>

<p class="center">WAYFARER</p>

<p>He ought to go with hurried step to the courts of kings.</p>

<p class="center">GENIUS</p>

<p>He does not care to, because he has a free heart. Your potentates sometimes
take pleasure in looking at songs, but what then? They requite
them with nods. Golden songs, drawn from the high heavens, they should
reward with jewels and with pure gold. But, frivolous as they are, they
instead foolishly give their grand gifts to fools, spendthrifts, and rogues.<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Alas! this depiction of the vices of society is not peculiar to the sixteenth century.
The world is very old, and it changes little. If Tory were
living in our day, it may be that he would use even darker colours; for,
after all, he was appreciated in his own time, and perhaps he would die
of hunger to-day. As we see, he was not fond of cooling his heels in the
antechambers of the great, and lived peacefully in his own house; but
honour came there to seek him. Unluckily it was a little late, as will appear
hereafter.</p>

<p>At the end of the poem is the design reproduced on the next page,
wherein we see for the first time the famous 'Pot Cassé' [broken jar]
which Tory adopted thenceforth as the mark of his bookshop; together
with the device 'non plus,' which he used thereafter instead of the word
'civis.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>Tory subsequently offered, in his 'Champ fleury,' a very confused
explanation of his Pot Cassé, doing his utmost to connect it with the
ordinary events of life; but everything tends to prove that it owes its
origin to the death of Agnes. This shattered antique vessel represents
Tory's daughter, whose career was shattered by destiny at the age of
ten. The book secured by padlocks
suggests Agnes's literary studies;
the little winged figure among the
clouds is her soul flying up to heaven.
The device 'non plus' suggests
the desperate grief of Tory, who
seems to say: 'I no longer [non plus]
care for anything'; or, more laconically:
'There is nothing more for
me'; after the example of Valentine
of Milan when he found himself
in a similar situation.<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 250px;">

</div>

<p>Luckily, time, which deadens
all sorrows, even those which seem
likely to endure for ever, assuaged
Tory's grief. Before his funeral poem
saw the light, he had returned
to his beloved studies, and they had
restored tranquillity to his mind.
This is proved by the following
passage from his 'Champ fleury,' in which he tells us how, on January 6,
1523 (or 1524, according to our method of computing time), that is to
say, eighteen months after he lost his daughter, the idea of that curious
book came to his mind. We are glad to recognize once more therein the
patriotic Berrichon who had taken for his device the word 'civis.'</p>

<p>'In the morning of the day of the feast of Kings,'<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> he says, '... which
was reckoned <span class="smcapa">M. D. XXIII</span>, the fancy came to me to muse in my bed, and
to move the wheel of my memory, thinking on a thousand petty conceits,
both serious and merry, whereamong I bethought me of a letter
of ancient form, which I not long since made for the house of my lord
the treasurer of the wars, Maistre Jehan Groslier, counsellor and secretary
to the king our sire, lover of goodly letters and of all learned persons,
of whom also he is greatly beloved and esteemed, as well on this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
side as the other of the mountains. And while thinking of that said antique
letter there came of a sudden to my memory a pithy sentence of
the first book and eighth chapter of Cicero's "Offices," where it is written:
"Non nobis solum nati sumus, ortusque nostri partem patria vendicat,
partem amici."<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> Which is to say, in substance, that we are not born into
this world for ourselves alone, but to do service and pleasure to our friends
and our country.'<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></p>

<p>Such was the origin of 'Champ fleury.' Here follows the composition
of that work, as the author himself gives it to us, in the form of a table
of contents, at the beginning:<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a>&mdash;</p>

<p>'This whole work is divided into three books.</p>

<p>'In the first book is contained the exhortation to establish and ordain
the French language by fixed rule, and to speak elegantly, in good and
soundest French.</p>

<p>'In the second is treated the invention of antique letters, and the proportionate
coincidence thereof with the natural body and face of the
perfect man. With several happy inventions and reflections upon the said
antique letters.</p>

<p>'In the third and last book all the said antique letters, in their alphabetical
order, are drawn and proportioned in height and width according
to their proper formation and required articulation, both Latin and
French, as well in the ancient as in the modern fashion.</p>

<p>'In two sheets at the end are added thirteen different sorts of letters,
to-wit: Hebrew, Greek, Latin, French,&mdash;and these latter in four sorts,
which are: "cadeaulx," "forme," "bastarde," and "torneure." Then follow
the Persian, Arabic, African, Turkish, and Tartar letters, which have,
all five, one and the same type of alphabet. After these are the Chaldaic,
the "goffes," which are otherwise called "impériales et bullatiques," the
"phantastiques" letters, the utopian letters, which one may call "voluntaires,"
and, lastly, the floriated letters.<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> With instructions for making<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
ciphers of letters for golden rings, for tapestries, stained-glass windows,
paintings, and other things, as may seem best.'</p>

<p>I will say nothing here of the first book, the excellence of which has
recently been pointed out by M. Génin,<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> who is much better versed in
the subject than I, and who has at the same stroke exculpated the French
from the charge that has been brought against them of having allowed
themselves to be anticipated by foreigners in the careful study of their
language. I will simply call attention to the fact that Tory wrote shortly
before Rabelais, who did not hesitate to borrow from him his criticism
of the 'skimmers of Latin,'<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> who were then changing the French language
on the pretext of perfecting it. The harangue of the Limousin
orator, which is found in the sixth chapter of the second book of 'Pantagruel,'
is copied verbatim from Tory's epistle to the reader.<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> Rabelais has
simply added to it some obscene reflections which did not enter our author's
mind. Tory ends with a pathetic appeal to those who are interested
in the mother tongue, whose excellence he is never tired of extolling.
'O ye devoted lovers of goodly letters!' he cries, 'God grant that some
noble heart may give itself to the task of establishing and ordering our
French tongue according to rule! By that means would many thousands
of men set themselves to using often goodly words. If it is not established
and ordered, we shall find that the French tongue will be in great part
changed and ruined every fifty years.'<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> This patriotic prayer was soon
granted. As we know, the sixteenth century did not lack great geniuses,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
who set the French language in order and brought it to a great degree
of perfection. Indeed, some most expressive words, the disuse of which
Tory deplored,<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> reappeared. For instance, 'affaissé' and 'tourbillonner,'
which in his time had been replaced by periphrases, returned into use;
many others deserve the same honour and perhaps will receive it some
day.</p>

<p>The second book of 'Champ fleury' is, I apprehend, only a paradox;
but that paradox is maintained by arguments so ingenious, that one
lacks courage to condemn it. Tory holds that the shapes of all the
roman capital letters are derived from the different parts of the human
body, which he looks upon as the type of the beautiful; and he makes
a most admirable use of wood engraving to explain his idea. Moreover,
if Tory was mistaken, we must acknowledge that he did not fall into
the error inconsiderately. Indeed, I believe that he had for confederate
his friend Perreal, to whom we may attribute the greater number of the
designs on wood in the second book, judging from those in the third,
which are directly attributed to him by Tory, as we shall see hereafter.
However that may be, Tory seems to have studied his subject for a long
time, not only on ancient monuments, but on modern ones as well, and
in the works of contemporary authors who had turned their attention
to the shapes of letters. His judgement of these latter is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>'Frère Lucas Paciol, of Bourg Saint Sepulchre, of the order of Frères
Mineurs, and a theologian, who has written in popular Italian a book
called "Divina proportione,"<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> and who has essayed to represent the said
antique letters, does not give a true account of them nor explain them;
and I am not surprised thereat, for I have heard from certain Italians that
he stole his said letters and took them from the late Messere Leonard
Vince [Leonardo da Vinci], who has of late died at Amboise, and was a
most excellent philosopher and admirable painter, and as it were another
Archimedes. This said Frère Lucas has caused his antique letters
to be printed as his own. In sooth they may well be his, for he has not
drawn them in their due proportions, as I shall show when I speak of
said letters. Nor does Sigismunde Fante, a noble of Ferrara, who teaches
how to write many kinds of letters, speak truly thereof.<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> Nor does Messere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
Ludovico Vincentino.<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> I know not whether Albert Dürer writes
justly thereof,<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> but none the less he goes astray in the due proportion of
the figures of many letters, in his book on "Perspective."<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a>... I see no
man who makes them or understands them better than Maistre Simon
Hayeneufve, otherwise called Maistre Simon du Mans. He makes them
so well and in proper proportions, that he satisfies the eye as well and
better than any Italian master on this side or the other of the mountains.
He is most excellent in the restoration of ancient architecture, as one
may see in a thousand excellent designs and portraits that he has made
in the noble city of Mans and in many a foreign city. He is worthy to
be held in honoured memory, as well for his upright life as for his noble
learning. And to this end, let us not fail to consecrate and dedicate his
name to immortality, naming him a second Vitruvius, a holy man and
good Christian. I write this with good will because of the virtues and
great praise "which I have heard said of him" by many great and humble
good men and true lovers of all goodly and honest things.'<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a></p>

<p>The eulogistic tone in which Tory speaks here and elsewhere<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> of
Simon Haieneuve leads M. Renouvier to think<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> that our artist may have
learned the art of drawing letters from the Mans architect; but it is
a mistaken supposition; the phrase in quotation marks proves that they
had never met. Moreover Tory, a little further on, claims most reasonably
the honour of having been his own master in this matter: 'I know
no Greek, Latin nor French author who gives the explanation of such
letters as I have described, wherefore I may hold it for my own, saying
that I have excogitated and found it rather by divine inspiration than by
anything written or heard. If there be any one who has seen it written,
let him say so, and he will give me pleasure.'<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a></p>

<p>We see that Tory does not beat about the bush concerning his theory,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
which, although it was different from those of his predecessors, was not
on that account better than theirs.<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> However, let his opinion concerning
the original design of the roman letters be what it may, it is, in my judgement,
simply a sort of preface which we may pass over without inconvenience.
The real substance of his work is in the third book. But he
does not leave the second without returning once more to the charge in
favour of his mother tongue.</p>

<p>'I know,' he says, 'that there are many goodly minds who would
willingly write many excellent things if they thought they could write
them well in Greek or Latin; and yet they abstain for fear of making
solecisms or some other fault that they dread; or they choose not to write
in French, thinking the French tongue not good nor elegant enough.
With all respect to them, it is one of the most beauteous and graceful
of all human tongues, as I have shown in the first book by the authority
of noble and ancient authors, poets and orators, as well Latin as Greek.'<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a></p>

<p>To be accurate, I will say that this idea of the 'preëxcellence of the
French tongue,' which, a little later, was the subject of another special
work on the part of another famous printer, the second Henri Estienne,
was neither new nor original with Tory. No less than three hundred years
before, it had been set forth in honest French by an author who cannot
be taxed with patriotic illusions, for he was an Italian. This is what
Brunetto Latini wrote at the beginning of a sort of encyclopædia which
he prepared in the thirteenth century, under the name of 'Trésor':&mdash;</p>

<p>'Et se aucuns demandoit por quoi cist livres est escriz en romans selonc
le langage des François, puisque nos somes Ytaliens, je diroie que
ce est por deux raisons: lune, car nos somes en France, et lautre, porce
que la parleure est plus delitable et plus commune a toutes gens.'<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a></p>

<p>As I have said, the third book is the important part of Tory's work.
Laying theory aside, he there gives us the exact design of the letters of
the alphabet and the method of executing them. He does not overlook,
moreover, this essential fact&mdash;that the designer of letters and the printer
ought before all else to be grammarians in the ancient meaning of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
word<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a>; and at the same time that he gives us the shape of a letter, he
instructs us as to its value and pronunciation. It is at this point that Tory's
book becomes especially interesting to us: he passes in review the pronunciation
in vogue in each of the French provinces, or nations, as they
were called then. One after another they appear before us, with their
special idioms, which have become mere myths to-day,&mdash;Flemings,
Burgundians, Lyonnaises, Forésiens, Manseaux, Berrichons, Normans,
Bretons, Lorrainers, Gascons, Picards, and even Italians, Germans, English,
Scotch, etc. His observations do not stop at the somewhat mixed idioms
of the men,<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> but extend to the more individual language of the women.
For instance, he informs us that 'the ladies of Lyon often gracefully
pronounce A for E, as when they say, "Choma vous choma chat effeta,"<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a>
and a thousand other like expressions'; whereas, on the contrary, 'the
ladies of Paris very often pronounce E instead of A, as when they say:
"Mon mery est a la porte de Peris, ou il se faict peier"; instead of saying,
"Mon mary est a la porte de Paris, ou il se faict paier."'<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a></p>

<p>It will be noticed that in this particular the 'ladies of Paris' succeeded
in perpetuating their pronunciation in part, for we do not now say 'paier.'
They had equal success in many other cases. For example, it seems to
be due to them that the final S of the plural is not pronounced except
under exceptional circumstances<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a>: as, for instance, when it is followed
by a word beginning with a vowel; for, speaking of the cases in which
that letter is elided in Latin, Tory expresses himself thus: 'The ladies of
Paris for the most part observe this poetic figure of speech, dropping
the final S in many words, as when, instead of saying: "Nous avons disne
en ung iardin, &amp; y avons menge des prunes blanches et noires, des amendes
doulces &amp; ameres, des figues molles, des pomes, des poires &amp; des
gruselles," they say and pronounce: "Nous avon disne en ung iardin, &amp;
y avon menge des prune blanche &amp; noire, des amende doulce &amp; amere,
des figue molle, des pome, des poyre &amp; des gruselle."' The thing that
seems especially offensive to Tory is that they make the men join them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
in this faulty pronunciation. 'This fault,' he says, 'would be pardonable
in them, were it not that it passes from woman to man, and that there
is entire absence of perfect pronunciation in speaking.'<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a></p>

<p>Moreover, if we are to credit Tory, the provincials have also, in certain
cases, succeeded in establishing their pronunciation, as we may conclude
from the following passage, relative to the letter T: 'The Italians
pronounce it so full and resonant that it seems that they add an E thereto,
as when, for and instead of saying: "Caput vertigine laborat," they pronounce:
"Capute vertigine laborate." I have seen and heard it pronounced
so in Rome at the schools called La Sapienza, and in many another noble
place in Italy. Which pronunciation is no wise held or used by the
Lionnois, who drop the said T, and do not pronounce it any wise at the
end of the third person plural of verbs active and neuter, saying "Amaverun"
and "Araverun," for "Amaverunt" and "Araverunt." In like manner
some Picards drop this T at the end of some words in French, as when
they would say: "Comant cela, comant? monsieur, c'est une jument,"
they pronounce: "Coman chela, coman? monsieur, chest une jumen."'<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a>
We see that the Picard pronunciation has prevailed in this instance, for
we no longer pronounce the final T at the end of the words 'comment,'
'jument,' and the like.</p>

<p>Tory did not content himself with setting forth the state of things
existent in his day: he suggested improvements, almost all of which
have been sanctioned by usage. For instance, at the beginning of the sixteenth
century, the pronunciation was very difficult to grasp for lack of
accents; he proposed to supply them. 'In our French language,' he
says, 'we have no symbol of accent in writing, and it is on account of
this lack that our language is not yet established nor submitted to fixed
rules, like the Hebrew, Greek and Latin. I would like that it should be,
as might well be done.... In French,' he says farther on, 'as I have
said, we do not write the accent over O vocative, but pronounce it full,
as when we say:</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">'O pain du ciel angelique,</div>
  <div class="i0">Tu es nostre salut antique.</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>'In this lack of accent we have an imperfection, which we ought to
remedy by purifying and subjecting to fixed rule and art our language,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
which is the most graceful language known.'<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> Elsewhere he suggests
replacing elided letters by an apostrophe, which had not then been done
in French. 'I say and allege these things in this place to the end that if
it should happen that one had to write in antique letters verses where
the S must disappear, one may write them honestly and purposely without
using the said letter, ... and place a hooked point over the place
where it should be.'<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> In another place he emphasizes the necessity of
the cedilla, which we find in French manuscripts from the thirteenth
century, but which typography had not as yet adopted. 'C before O,'
he says, 'in French pronunciation and language, is sometimes hard, as
in saying "coquin," "coq," "coquillard"; sometimes it is soft, as in saying
"garcon," "macon," "françois," and other like words.'<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a></p>

<p>Tory could hardly overlook the matter of punctuation, that most essential,
and even in our day so sadly neglected, branch of orthography;
but as he had only 'antique' letters to deal with, he presented only three
sorts of punctuation marks, without going into details as to their use,
which, in truth, if we may judge by his own book, was not as yet fully
settled. The comma, for instance, which has so much to do with the
clearness of the sentence, is frequently there inserted in a far from rational
way.</p>

<img src="images/i_b_020.jpg" width="123" height="200" alt="" />
</div>

<p>I have said above that Tory had adopted about 1523, for the mark of
his bookshop, the Pot Cassé represented in the engraving
placed at the end of his poem on his daughter's death.
To make it more appropriate for that purpose, he subjected
it to various modifications. At first we find it alone,
as in the accompanying cut, on the cover,<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> or on the back,<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a>
of a number of octavo books bound at his establishment.
Other bindings, in quarto, exhibit the broken jar with
the drill (<em>toret</em>).<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a></p>

<p>Afterward, Tory placed the jar on a closed book, and still later he
modified the design by the introduction of other additions.<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>Finally, we have Geofroy Tory's device, or mark, definitively constituted
in his 'Champ fleury,' thus:<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a>&mdash;</p>

<p>'Behold,' he says, 'my declared device and
mark, drawn as I have cogitated and conceived
it, imparting moral meaning thereto, to give
friendly admonition to the printers and booksellers
beyond the mountains<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> to practise and
employ themselves in goodly inventions and delectable
execution, to show that their wits have
not been always useless, but eager to serve the
public weal by labouring to that end and living
uprightly.'</p>

<p>Then follows his explanation of this mark,<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a>&mdash;an
explanation which does not invalidate that
suggested above.<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> In truth, all that Tory says
here in general terms may be applied to his
daughter Agnes.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 200px;">
<img src="images/i_b_021.jpg" width="200" height="417" alt="MENTI BONAE DEVS OCCVRRIT SIC VT VEL VT NON PLVS" />
</div>

<p>'In the first place, there is herein an ancient
jar, which is broken, through which is passed
a toret. This said broken jar signifies our body, which is an earthen
jar. The toret signifies Fate, which pierces and passes through weak and
strong. Beneath this broken jar there is a book secured by three chains
and padlocks, which signifies that after our body is broken by death, its
life is closed by the three fatal goddesses.<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> This book is so firmly closed
that there is no man who may come to see anything therein, except he
know the secret of the padlocks, and above all of the round padlock,
which is locked and signed by letters. Even so, after the book of our life
is closed, there is no man who may in any wise open it, except it be he
who knows the secrets, and he is God, who alone knows, before and after
our death, what has been, what is, and what will be our fate. The foliage
and flowers in the said jar signify the virtues which our body may have
in itself during its life. The sun-rays which are above and beside the toret
and the jar signify the inspiration that God gives us by impelling us to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
virtue and worthy acts. Near the said broken jar it is written: "Non
plvs," which are two monosyllabic words, as well in French as in Latin,
signifying that which Pittacus said long since in Greek: ΜΗΔΕΝΑΓΑΝ,<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a>
"nihil nimis." Let us not say, let us not do aught beyond measure or beyond
reason, except it be in the last necessity: "aduersus quā nec Dij
quidē pugnant."<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> But let us say and let us do "Sic. vt. vel. vt." That is to
say, as we ought, or as little wrongly as we may. If we seek to do well,
God will aid us, and therefore have I written above: "Menti bonæ Deus
occurrit," that is to say, God goes out to meet the desire to do good, and
gives it aid.'</p>

<p>I believe that we should see in the toret an 'enseigne parlante,' alluding
at once to Tory's name and to his various professions. The way in
which the name of the instrument was pronounced, its shape, resembling
that of a T, and, lastly, its use by the engravers, were doubtless the
considerations that led Tory to adopt it. But let us not subtilize too far.</p>

<p>Tory was not content with giving us his symbol in 'Champ fleury':
he engraved on the first page of that book, that is to say, in the place of
honour, what would be called to-day the blazonry of his artistic acquirements,&mdash;in
other words, a collection of all the tools that he used. Unfortunately,
he did not feel called upon, as in the case of his mark, to supply
an explanation, deeming the matter clear enough; whereas, in our day
it has become rather difficult, because of the changes that have taken
place in the customs of artists, to state the exact use of some of the tools.
The order in which they are arranged, however, may assist us, to a certain
extent, in identifying them. An exact reproduction of this engraving,
the initial letter of the first page of the text of 'Champ fleury,' is
given at the beginning of this section.<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a></p>

<p>The first series of tools, suspended in the first arabesque, embraces a
pair of compasses, a rule, and a square: these are the fundamental instruments
of art and of geometry. In the second arabesque, if I am not mistaken,
we find an 'échoppe' and a burin, engravers' tools; in the third,
a writing-case (or 'galimart'), a pencil, and a knife, above a book; these
are the tools of the writer and the draughtsman. In the fourth, we find
an object which I take to be a small box of colours, hanging from a case
of brushes; these appertain to the painter. Tory was, in fact, draughtsman,
painter and engraver.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 250px;">
<img src="images/i_b_023.jpg" width="250" height="407" alt="" />
</div>

<p>I have already said that Tory was probably instructed in the art of
drawing by the famous Jean Perreal. He was on terms of the closest
friendship with that artist, who drew several of the vignettes in 'Champ
fleury,' if we may judge by the one positively attributed to him, which
is printed on the verso of folio 46. Geofroy informs us that this plate,
insignificant in itself (it represents two circles in which are the letters
I and K, modelled on the human body), was engraved from the design
of a friend of his, 'from that which a noble lord and good friend of
mine, Jehan Perreal, who is otherwise called Jehan de Paris, valet de
chambre and excellent painter to King Charles VIII, Louis XII, and
François, first of the name, made known and gave to me, most
excellently drawn by his hand.' Now this engraving is in all respects
similar to those to be found in the second book of 'Champ fleury.' Both in
form and subject, it is altogether different from those in the third book,
in which Tory printed it. Probably Perreal died while the
work was on the press, and Tory, who had not thought of naming him
while he was alive, in connection with his first drawings, did so after his
death, by publishing the last souvenir of this sort which he possessed from
the hand of his friend, although it did not fit perfectly with the subject;
he laid, as it were, a flower on the dead man's grave.<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>We give this drawing also, as the only work which can be with certainty
attributed to Jean Perreal, and as a specimen of the engravings
which serve as a foundation for the reformation of the roman letters
proposed by Tory in the second book of his 'Champ fleury.'</p>

<p>From what I have said it will be seen that Tory's book required several
years of labour. Nor is one surprised thereat when one considers the
great number of engravings which it contains. But even without the engravings,
it will readily be understood that a work which necessitated so
much observation required a vast expenditure of time. Begun, as we have
seen, in 1523 (1524, new style), it was not finally completed until 1529,
that is to say, after six years of toil. However, Tory did not propose that
those years should be lost for art. Desirous to preach by example rather
than by precept, he determined to publish, in the interim, other books
wherein he might give utterance to his artistic taste. And he did in fact
print books of Hours, admirably executed, which, although in different
form, may fitly be compared to the Hours of Simon Vostre, who had
acquired so great a reputation in that typographical specialty. Tory received
from François I a 'privilége' (license) for this work, to run six
years, dated at Avignon, September 23, 1524.<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> This license to print<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> informs
us that Tory had 'made and caused to be made<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> certain illustrations
[<i>histoires</i>] and vignettes "a lantique" and likewise some "a la
moderne," in order to have the same printed, and to serve <i>a plusieurs
usages dheures</i>,' and that to that end he had 'expended an exceeding
long time and incurred divers great expenses and outlays.'</p>

<p>The first book of this sort which he published, so far as I have learned,
is an edition in quarto of the Hours of the Virgin, according to the
Roman use, in Latin. It is a superb volume, printed by Simon de Colines,
with borders and illustrations 'à l'antique,' perfect in taste and execution.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>The book was undoubtedly printed by Colines as a joint venture with
Tory, for there are copies in existence in the name of each. Those in the
name of Colines bear on the title-page the date 1524, and, at the end,
that of the 17th of the Calends of February (January 16), 1525; those
in the name of Tory (there are two varieties of these) bear but one date,
1525, and that at the end. I shall speak of this book later, in detail.<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a></p>

<p>Two years later Tory published a new edition of the same Hours,
in a small octavo volume, also printed by Simon de Colines, in roman
type, with borders and illustrations of the same kind but much smaller.<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a>
The printing was finished October 21, 1527. It is preceded by a new
license from François I, extending Tory's rights for ten years, not for
this book alone, but for the earlier one as well, 'for certain illustrations
and vignettes "a lantique" by him heretofore printed,' and in consideration
of the great outlay which his engravings had caused him to make.
This license is dated at Chenonceaux, September 5, 1526, and includes
'Champ fleury,' the printing of which had begun, but which had not
yet received its poetic title, for it was still referred to as 'Lart et science
de la deue et vraye proportion des lettres.' In the same year Tory published
an edition in quarto of these same Hours, according to the use
of Paris, printed by Simon Dubois (Silvius). This book, in which we find
again the license of 1526, is printed in gothic type, with borders and illustrations
of a special style, called 'à la moderne.' The borders are arabesques
formed of plants, insects, birds, animals, etc. At the foot we see
the F, crowned, of François I, and the salamander; the L, crowned, of
Louise of Savoy, the king's mother; and the impaled shield of France
and Savoy, etc. Of this book also I shall speak in detail hereafter.<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> Finally,
a little later, at a time which I am unable to fix precisely, but prior to
1531, Tory caused to be printed another book of Hours of the same
description, that is to say, with borders of plants, insects, birds, etc., but
in a smaller format&mdash;small octavo. I shall describe it in its place.<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a></p>

<p>These publications did not prevent our artist from giving his attention
to literature. While he was overlooking the impression of his Hours
and his 'Champ fleury,' he was preparing various works to which we
shall have occasion to refer hereafter. Generally speaking, they are translations
intended to enrich the French tongue; for Tory did not lose sight
of his patriotic purpose. All of these works were printed subsequently,
save one, perhaps&mdash;a translation of the hieroglyphs of Orus Apollo,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
which he gave to a 'noble lord and good friend of his.'<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> It is not known
whether this translation was ever printed. There are many editions of
Orus in existence, but no one of them bears the name of Tory.</p>

<p>'Champ fleury' appeared at last in 1529. We have seen that this book
was conceived on 'the day of the feast of Kings, which was reckoned
<span class="smcapa">M. D. XXIII</span>,' that is to say, January 6, 1524, new style. The printing was
not completed until 'the <span class="smcapa">XXVIII</span> day of the month of April one thousand
five hundred <span class="smcapa">XXIX</span>,'<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> as we learn from the subscription at the end;
that is to say, it cost nearly six years of toil. The following is an exact
copy of the title-page as it appears in the first edition:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>CHAMP FLEVRY. Au quel est contenu Lart &amp; Science de la deue
&amp; vraye Proportiõ des Lettres Attiques, quõ dit autremēt Lettres Antiques,
&amp; vulgairement Lettres Romaines, proportionnees selon le Corps
&amp; Visage humain.&mdash;Ce Liure est Priuilegie pour Dix Ans Par Le Roy
nostre Sire, &amp; est a vendre a Paris sus Petit Pont a Lenseigne du Pot
Casse par Maistre Geofroy Tory de Bourges/Libraire, &amp; Autheur du dict
Liure. Et par Giles Gourmont aussi Libraire demourant en la Rue sainct
Iaques a Lenseigne des Trois Coronnes.</p></blockquote>

<p>It is gratifying to see here the name of the first printer in Greek type
in Paris. It was Gourmont himself who printed this learned book, wherein
we find some very interesting details concerning the Hebrew, Greek and
Latin letters, of which he exhibits models which have not changed since
that time.<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> The workshop of Gilles de Gourmont was on rue Saint-Jean-de-Latran;
but we see that in 1529 he had a bookshop on rue Saint-Jacques,
at the sign of the Trois Couronnes,&mdash;an allusion doubtless to
the three roses which adorned the chief, or top, of his shield. This shop
adjoined the church of Saint-Benoît on the north.<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> As for Tory, he seems
to have lived at this time on the Petit-Pont, 'next to Hostel-Dieu.' It
was there that he wrote his book, for he dates his epistle to the reader
thus: 'En Paris ce. <span class="smcapa">XXVIII</span>. Jour Dapvril sus Petit Pont, a Lenseigne du Pot
Casse.' He had, however, another abode on rue Saint-Jacques, opposite
the 'Écu de Bâle,' the sign of Chrétien Wechel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>At the beginning of 'Champ fleury' is printed the license of September
5, 1526, already published in the two editions of the Hours of 1527,
which granted to Tory a ten years' right, not only for the Hours, but
also for 'Champ fleury,' which was then being printed, but, as I have
already said, had not then received that graceful title. This license makes
it clear that as early as 1526 Tory was thinking of joining the brotherhood
of printers. He became a printer in fact soon after the publication
of his book, and proceeded to print several works of his own composition.
I give here a list of these various publications, in the order of their
dates.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I. La Table de lancien philosophe Cebes ... Avec trente Dialogues
moraulx de Lucian ... translate de latin en vulgaire françois par maistre
Geofroy Tory de Bourges...<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The license is of September 18, 1529, for ten years. The printing was
finished October 5, 1529. It is a small octavo volume, in two parts, with
roughly executed borders on each page. There are twelve preliminary
leaves, containing a long list of errata, and two series of signatures, the
first running from A to T, the second from <i>a</i> to <i>v</i>. The book was for
sale at the translator's shop, 'rue Sainct Iaques, devant lescu de Basle,<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> a
lenseigne du Pot Casse,' and at Jean Petit's on 'rue Sainct Iaques, a lenseigne
de la Fleur de lys.' There is nothing to indicate where the book
was printed; but as it is set in the type used for the 'Epitaphs' of Louise
of Savoy, I am inclined to think that it came from Tory's workshop.
In that case it was the first book that he printed.<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> The long list of errata
would seem, in truth, to suggest a novice, and would explain why
no printer's name is given.</p>

<p>In the letter 'to the readers' at the beginning of this book, Tory returns
to the charge against the villains [<i>rufients</i>] who were changing the
French language on the pretext of perfecting it. There are some tirades
quite worthy of a place in 'Champ fleury.' He ends his preamble with
a curious passage which gives us an idea of his tastes. 'I believe that if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
the ancient and noble painter Zeuxis of Heraclea, if Raphael of Urbino,

informs the reader that he will soon make him 'another new gift';<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> and
he kept his promise by publishing the following work.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>II. Summaire de chroniques contenans les vies, gestes et cas fortuitz
de tous les empereurs Deurope, depuis Iules Cesar iusques a Maximilien
dernier decede ... par ... Iehan Baptiste Egnace, Venicien. Et translate

<p>An octavo volume, containing 16 leaves of preface, 99 of text, and an
index containing 13 leaves&mdash;128 in all. At the end, we read: 'The printing
of this book was finished at Paris the <span class="smcapa">XIII</span> day of April, <span class="smcapa">M. D. XXIX</span>, for
maistre Geofroy Tory de Bourges, who sells it at said Paris, at the sign of
the Pot Casse.' In Tory's preface, addressed 'to all studious and true lovers
of honest letters,' he says: 'I promised you of late in the preface to the
"Table of Cebes" that in a short space I would make for you another
new book.' It was in fulfilment of that promise that he published the
'Summaire de Chroniques' of Egnasio.</p>

<p>The date of printing given above corresponds to April 13, 1530, new
style; for Easter fell in that year on April 15. Some bibliographers mention
an edition of this book of 1520; but it is an error, for the license is
dated 1529. La Caille<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> says that the edition of 1529 was printed by Tory;
this is possible, but not certain. It may even be that it was printed by
Gourmont, for it is set in the same type used in 'Champ fleury.'<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> There
are three later editions of this book, printed by Charles l'Angelier in 1541,
1543, 1544 (octavo); we shall speak of them hereafter. As for the edition
of 1529, I found it only in the library of M. Ambroise Firmin Didot,
who kindly allowed me to describe it. This copy is still in the original
binding, with the Pot Cassé.</p>

<p>But all these works did not cause Tory to lose sight of his great patriotic
idea. He did not confine himself to simple wishes for the welfare
of the French language. In default of the other 'noble hearts' whom he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
invited 'to establish and order our language by rule,'<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> he himself undertook
that work. Rich in materials as he was, and with the ardor with
which he entered into everything, he soon completed his task. The license
to print the 'Summaire de Chroniques' includes a book by Tory
entitled: 'Les Reigles generales de lorthographe du langaige françois,'
which he proposed soon to put on the press. Was this book ever printed?
was it ever finished? These are questions which I am unable to answer,
for I have discovered no trace of it elsewhere; but so many other books
have disappeared that I should not be surprised to learn that this one had
undergone the same fate.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>III. Hours (in Latin) according to the Roman use; sixteenmo, with
illustrations and borders; printed in roman type; finished February 8,
1529, which date corresponds to February 8, 1530, new style, and proves
that Tory had become a printer in 1529. Here is the exact title of this
book, which I shall describe in detail later:<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> 'Horæ in laudem beatissimæ

<p>Paris, Simon de Colines, 1530;<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> italic type; 3 octavo sheets, with license
for two years. This book has, in the second part, seven charming
engravings on wood. I cannot understand why Tory did not print it, as
he was then a printer. May it have been because it was customary at
that time to print poetical works in italic type, and he had none in his
printing office? Copies of the book are preserved in the Bibliothèque
Nationale, at the Arsenal [two] and at Sainte-Geneviève. The copy in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
the Bibliothèque Nationale is still in the original binding, with the Pot
Cassé.<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a></p>

<p>Alluding to the first part of his book, Tory expresses himself thus in
his 'avis au lecteur': 'There are certain eminent painters in this prolific
age, most gentle reader, who, by their drawings, paintings, and varied
colouring, depict the tribal gods and human beings, as also other things
of different sorts, with such exactness that a voice and a soul seem the
only things wanting to them; but here, most gentle reader, I offer you,
nearly in the manner of these painters, a house, which not only is elegant
and finished in its outlines and parts, but even speaks prettily and describes
itself part by part in a eulogy.'<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> It will be seen that Tory's thoughts
were still engrossed by art.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>V. Science pour senrichir honnestement et facilement, intitulée Leconomic
Xenophon, nagueres translatee de grec et latin en langaige francoys,

<p>Octavo, of 9 sheets; printing finished July 5, 1531.<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> On the back of the
title-page are these words: 'At the said sign of the Pot Casse are also for
sale Thucydides and Diodorus, with some other excellent books translated
from Greek and Latin into French. Likewise there are fine Hours
and Offices of Our Lady, large, medium and small, with illustrations and
vignettes "a l'antique."'</p>

<p>Were the Thucydides and Diodorus printed by Tory, as well as the
large, medium and small Hours? Possibly, but I have found no indication
of it. As for attributing the translations to him, that is out of the
question, for he says nothing of it in the dedication, addressed to Antoine
du Prat, Cardinal de Sens, etc., wherein he mentions the preceding works
of the same sort:&mdash;</p>

<p>'After the book of the Explanation of the antique letters, called
"Champ Fleury," which I put together in the French language, and
the "Table de Cebes," with thirty moral dialogues; likewise the "Summaire
de Chroniques," which I translated into our said language, to confer
a benefit on the studious, ... it seemed to me to be a worthy way of
passing my time to employ myself in translating the "Economic Xenophon"
also.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>Tory does not mention here the 'Ædiloquium,' probably because that
book was in Latin, or, rather, because it was not printed at the time of
the composition of this dedication, which was in all probability written
in the first three months of 1531, then reckoned in the year 1530,<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> a
circumstance which, in my opinion, explains the date of the 'Ædiloquium.'
In fact, that book cannot have been printed before 1531, for the
license of the 'Economic Xenophon,' which includes the 'Ædiloquium'
(to which, by the way, it gives a sub-title, 'et Erotica,' which was rejected
when it was printed, as likely to give a false idea of the book), is
dated June 18, 1531, and extends Tory's rights to four years instead of
the two mentioned on the title-page of the 'Ædiloquium.' From all of
which I conclude that the last-named book was printed before the license
was obtained, but only a short time before, and while the application was
pending.</p>

<p>The license first mentioned<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> also concedes to Tory an extension of
four years 'for certain other books, illustrations and vignettes, to cause
to be printed the Hours and Offices of Our Lady, mentioned in two
licenses heretofore granted to him,' dated September 23, 1524, and September
5, 1526. Tory requested this extension of time because he was
preparing to reprint the Hours, as we see by the date of the following
book.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>VI. Hours according to the Roman use, quarto; published October
20, 1531, in Latin. This was a new edition of the Hours printed in 1524-1525
by Simon de Colines. We find the same borders and illustrations
as before; but several engravings which had already appeared in some
of the earlier books just described are added. I shall describe this book
later. It seems to be printed from the 'Champ fleury' type, and bears the
following title: Horæ in laudem beatiss. Virginis Mariæ. Ad usum romanum.
Parrhisiis apud Gotofredum Torinum Biturigicum, regium

<p>Octavo, 8 leaves; without date of printing or license, but printed by
Geofroy Tory himself, after February 22, 1533; for he assumes the title
of 'libraire juré'<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> of the University, which did not belong to him until
that day. Moreover he makes use in this book of the acute accent, the
apostrophe and the cedilla, which he never used, as we shall soon see,
until after the edition of Clement Marot, dated June 7, 1533. It was
therefore subsequent to that date, but prior to October of the same year,
that 'La Mouche' was published.<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In several of the works we have described, Tory assumes the title of
printer; in the last three he describes himself as king's printer, and in
one of them as a 'libraire juré' of the University. These last two dignities
he owed to the initiative of François I. That king, who had never
before conferred that honour upon any one, deemed it his duty to make
the author of 'Champ fleury' king's printer. In truth it was natural
enough to confer that title upon him who had displayed so perfect an
understanding of the art of typography, combined with such a store of
literary knowledge, and whose book caused a veritable revolution in
printing, no less from the technical and practical than from the grammatical
and philological standpoint; for there is one fact which I have
not as yet mentioned and which I am glad to set down here: immediately
after the publication of 'Champ fleury' French typography began to include
in its fonts of type accents, apostrophes and cedillas,<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> the absence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
of which Tory deplored, and which he himself used soon after, and before
any other printer, as we shall see.</p>

<p>But the most noteworthy result produced by the publication of
'Champ fleury' was the reformation of the old types. That book not only
contributed to the abandonment of gothic letters, but brought about the
remodelling of the old roman letters. Robert Estienne, among others, re-cast
at this time all those that had come down to him from his father,
the first Henri (or, to speak more accurately, from his father-in-law Simon
de Colines), and replaced them by types of a new shape, which were cut,
I think, by Tory (for his pupil, Garamond, seems not to have been capable
of doing it at this time), and which continued to be used, almost
without change, down to the time of the Revolution. It is in this sense
only that it can properly be said that Tory perfected the types of Josse
Bade; for I think that he did not cut any type for that celebrated printer,
who was established in Paris long before Tory turned his attention to
engraving, and who died in 1535, a few years after the publication of
'Champ fleury,' without changing in any way his method of printing.
It was Tory too, doubtless, who cut Robert Estienne's italic type; for it
bears a strong resemblance to Simon de Colines's, which I have already
attributed to him.<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a></p>

<p>The sensation caused by Tory's book, in foreign countries as well as
in France, is evidenced also by the writings of his contemporaries. In Paris,
Antoine du Saix, author of the 'Esperon de discipline,' expresses himself
thus in an epistle in verse dedicated to his friends,<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> among whom we find
mentioned René Massé, also a friend of Tory, and several other littérateurs
of the time:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>In London, Leonard Coxe, alluding to the grammar published shortly
after by his compatriot Palsgrave, exclaims: 'Learned Geofroy, he has
fulfilled the wish so often expressed in thy "Champ fleury," for here we
have the French language taught thoroughly, by virtue of rules duly authorized.'<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a></p>

<p>Tory probably received the title of king's printer in 1530, but I do not
find that he assumed it earlier than 1531, and, failing documentary
evidence, I cannot accredit him with it at an earlier date. It was, I fancy,
his appointment which led the authors of the 'Art de vérifier les dates'
to say that 'François I established the Imprimerie Royale in Paris' on his
return from the Abbaye de Veyen, where he had espoused, on July 4,
1530, Eleonora, sister of the Emperor Charles V.<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> It is the fact that at
that time Tory was entrusted with several 'royal printings' concerning
this marriage of the king. Thus he published, March 16, 1530 (1531,
new style), a little work of Guillaume Bochetel, entitled: 'Le Sacre et
coronnement de la Royne, imprimé par le commandement du Roy nostre
sire.' It is a thin quarto of 12 leaves, printed with a certain sumptuousness,
and the license, signed 'de la Barre,'<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> is thus conceived:&mdash;</p>

<p>'We have granted to maistre Geofroy Tory, "marchant libraire, imprimeur,"
license to print the "Coronnement de la Royne," and all other
printers are forbidden to print it for one year,<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> upon pain of a discretionary
fine and of the confiscation of said book, etc. Done at Paris the tenth day
of March.' The consecration of the queen had taken place at Saint-Denis
five days earlier, March 5, 1530 (1531, new style).</p>

<p>A few days later Tory published another little book by the same author:
'Lentree de la Royne en sa ville et cite de Paris, imprimee par
commandement du Roy nostre sire.' Quarto, 24 leaves; same arrangement
as in 'le Sacre,' etc.<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> The license, dated at Anet, April 26, 1531 (Easter
fell that year on April 9), gives Tory no other title than 'libraire,' but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
the omission is evidently accidental.<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> The volume contains three pieces
in Latin verse by Geofroy Tory, two addressed to the queen ('ad reginam
Leonorem'), the other to the French people ('ad gentem gallicam'). On
the verso of the last leaf are these words: 'The printing of this book
was finished Tuesday the ninth day of May <span class="smcapa">M. D. XXXI.</span>' This book exhibits
specimens of three different types used by Geofroy Tory: a 'saint-augustin,'
in which the text is printed, a 'philosophie,'<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> and a brevier. In
all these publications we find Tory's borders and his broken jar, and these
words at the foot of the title: On les vend a Paris, en la rue Sainct Jacques,
devant lescu de Basle, et devant lesglise de la Magdaleine, a lenseigne
du Pot Casse.'</p>

<p>It will be noticed that Tory had left his second domicile, on the Petit-Pont,
which was too small, doubtless, for his printing establishment, and
had settled in the heart of the Cité, almost opposite the church of La
Madeleine, which then stood very near the corner of rue de la Juiverie
and rue de Marmouzets. His new abode was on the site of the old and
famous Halle aux Blés de Beauce, in a house to which he transported
his sign of the Pot Cassé (which it retained for several years), and which
corresponds to the present number 16 rue de la Cité, according to the evidence
courteously furnished me by M. Adolphe Berty, whose knowledge
of old Paris is so thorough.<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> However that may be, the first work in which
to my knowledge Geofroy Tory assumes the title of king's printer is a
thin volume of two and a half quarto sheets, of the same typographical
arrangement as those last described, but printed in different type, which
seems to me to have been cut by Tory. It was published on the occasion
of the death of Louise of Savoy, mother of François I, which occurred September
22, 1531. The contents consist of Latin and French epitaphs composed
in honour of the deceased, and it bears on its first page the following
title, bisected:&mdash;</p>

<p>'In Lodoicæ regis matris mortem epitaphia latina et gallica.&mdash;Epitaphes
a la louenge de ma dame mere du Roy faictz par plusieurs recommendables
autheurs.' Below this are these words: 'On les vend a Paris,
devant Leglise de la Magdaleine, a Lenseigne du Pot Casse.'</p>

<p>The license, dated at Paris, October 15, 1531, and signed de la Barre, accords<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
unequivocally to Tory the title of king's printer: 'We have granted
to maistre Geofroy Tory, merchant, bookseller and <em>imprimeur du roy</em>,
leave,' etc. On the last page, which, like the first, is enclosed in a border,
are the words: 'Printed at Paris at the sign of the Pot Cassé, by maistre
Geofroy Tory de Bourges, Marchant, Libraire et Imprimeur du Roy. The
<span class="smcapa">XVII</span> day of October <span class="smcapa">M. D. XXXI</span>.'<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a></p>

<p>What salary did Tory receive as king's printer? It is impossible for
me to say positively; however, if we may judge from what happened
in 1538, in the case of Conrad Néobar,<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> he probably received 100 'écus
au soleil'<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> per year, which, at the current valuation of 45 sous each,
would make 225 'livres tournois.' Indeed, that sum was paid in 1671,
more than a century later, to Pierre Le Petit, king's printer.<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a></p>

<p>If François I manifested his good will to Geofroy Tory in appointing
him king's printer, he manifested it even more signally by causing him to
be admitted to the brotherhood of 'libraires jurés' of the University, with
all the privileges appurtenant to that office.<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> For, in the first instance, he
simply made use of his prerogative; in the second he imposed his will
on the University: the number of 'libraires jurés,' which was fixed at
twenty-four, being full, François I created a twenty-fifth membership
in Tory's favour, and the University ratified that creation at its sitting
of February 22, 1532 (1533, new style), minuting, however, that it was
a gift of the King,<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> as if to imply that it was not to be taken as a precedent.
In fact, they returned to the number twenty-four on the death
of Tory, which unfortunately was not long delayed.</p>

<p>Farther on will be found a list of the works published by Tory as
king's printer, both for the king and for private individuals.<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> I will mention
here a single one, which is of some interest in connection with the biography
of our artist: the 'Adolescence Clementine' (of Clement Marot),
fourth edition, published by Tory June 7, 1533. On the title-page is a
note in these words: 'With certain accents noted, namely, on É masculine
different from the feminine, between words joined by synalephe, and
under Ç when it is pronounced like S, the which heretofore, for lack of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
suggestion, has not been done in the French language, although it was
and is most essential.' This was the first work in which Tory applied the
orthographic system he had suggested in 'Champ fleury.'<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> The fact is
evident from the inexperience of the compositors, who made several
blunders in this very note.</p>

<p>This book, one of the rare copies of which is in the Bibliothèque Nationale,
presents still another interesting peculiarity. The title-page is
arranged in a different way from that in vogue at the time. In the first
three editions the first two words form four lines of capitals of the same
size and length, by virtue of the spacing: LADOLE&mdash;SCENCE&mdash;CLEMEN&mdash;TINE.
In the fourth edition they fill two lines only
(LADOLESCENCE&mdash;CLEMENTINE), but still in type of the same
size, contrary to the practice of other printers, who would have diminished
by at least one degree the size and length of the lines, without regard
to logic. They would probably have printed the title thus:</p>

<p class="center"><span class="bigger110">L A D O L E S</span><br />
CENCE CLEMEN<br />
tine</p>

<p>Tory's method of execution, which he borrowed from the arrangement
of ancient inscriptions, was less agreeable to the eye perhaps, but it was
more logical. It was a step toward the practice of the present day, in
which the size of the letters on a title-page is varied, but is made consistent
with the importance of the respective words. As will be seen, Tory
was, in everything, an initiator.</p>

<p>This book was the last one printed by Tory, to my knowledge. He
probably died shortly after, for we find that his wife was a widow on
October 14 [1533], when she executed a lease for nine years of that part
of the Halle de Beauce occupied by her husband's establishment. This
lease, covering the whole house, was made in consideration of 122 livres
10 sous tournois. The lessors were agents of the Chapitre Notre-Dame,
and the lessees, 'Martin Féret, baker, and Perrette Le Hullin, widow of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
Geofroy Tory, in his lifetime bookseller and king's printer, living on rue
de la Juifverie in one of the wings [corps d'hostel] of the building hereinafter
mentioned' (the Halle de Beauce).<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a></p>

<p>Perrette Le Hullin continued for some time to carry on her husband's
various enterprises. Thus, she published in 1535 a remarkable work,
doubtless begun by him, by command of François I, to whom it is dedicated.
It certainly should be placed to the credit of Tory, although it
does not bear his name, but simply a mention of his sign: 'Au Pot Casse.'
It is a translation of Diodorus Siculus, of which I shall speak later.<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a></p>

<p>But the burden of so considerable an undertaking&mdash;printing-office,
bookshop, bindery,<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> engraving, etc.&mdash;soon compelled Perrette Le Hullin
to abandon a part of it. At the end of the year 1535 she transferred the
printing-office, the bookshop, and the bindery to Olivier Mallard, who
established himself on the same premises occupied by Tory, and under
the same sign of the Pot Cassé, as we see by a thin volume published
by him on January 19, 1535 (1536, new style), entitled: 'Copie d'une
lettre de Constantinople, de la victoire du grand Sophy contre le grand
Turc.&mdash;Paris, Olivier Mallard, à l'enseigne du Pot Cassé, rue de la Juifverie.'
Quarto, of 4 leaves; gothic type.<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a></p>

<p>Towards the end of 1536, Mallard published the 'Copie de l'arrest du
grand conseil donné à l'encontre du miserable empoisonneur de monseigneur
le dauphin,' etc. An octavo sheet printed in two signatures. On
the verso of the title begins the text of the decree, promulgated at
Lyon Saturday, October 7, 1536; then come several pieces by Jean Henon
and 'a "dizain" by the printer hereof in sorrow for the death of the Dauphin':
ten wretched lines, ending, by way of signature, with the words<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
'tout par moien,' of which I have been unable to discover the anagrammatic
significance. On the verso of the last leaf we read: 'All booksellers
and printers in the city and provostry of Paris are forbidden to print or
put on sale this present "copie" within three months, on pain of confiscation
thereof, and of a fine, save only M. O. Mallard. Given at Paris this
<span class="smcapa">XVIII</span> October, 1536.&mdash;I. M<span class="smcapa">ORIN.</span>'</p>

<p>Thus we see that, even if Mallard was not as yet king's printer, he was at
least the official printer. I cannot give the exact date of his appointment
as king's printer; but he certainly held that office in 1537, since in that
year he published a little octavo volume in which he assumed the title.<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a>
The book is entitled: 'De judiciis urinarum tractatus exprobatis collectus
authoribus, etc.&mdash;Excudebat O. Mallardus, bibliopola ac impressor regius.&mdash;Anno
Domini 1537, 8 id. Martii' (March 8).<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> He also published in that
year, in the same capacity, two works of Jean Gillot:<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> 'De juridictione
et imperio libri duo,' and 'Isagoge in juris civilis sanctionem' (quarto),
on the title-page of which, below the Pot Cassé, are the words: 'Vænit
O. Mallardo, regio typographo ac librario, sub signo Vasis fracti.'<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a></p>

<p>It is probable that François I made no difficulty about accepting
Tory's successor as his printer; but he availed himself of Tory's death
to remodel the institution of king's printers. He restricted Mallard's
functions to the printing of French, and in the year 1538 appointed two
other king's printers, one, Conrad Néobar, for Greek, the other, Robert
Estienne, for Latin and Hebrew, as an essential complement to the 'Collége
des trois langues,' now the Collége de France, which he had recently
founded. We have not the document which conferred upon Robert
Estienne the title of king's printer; but we have proof that he held that
title in 1539. Maittaire declares, upon what evidence I know not, that
Robert was appointed on June 24 of that year. I am of the opinion that
his appointment was of earlier date, that is to say, that it goes back, like
Néobar's, to 1538, or, to speak more accurately, to the beginning of
1539. In fact, we find him assuming the title of king's printer ('typographus
regius') in several works printed by him during that year.
Furthermore, I may mention the fact that, in a most interesting edict
concerning the printers of France, dated August 31, 1539, the king<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
already refers to the fact that he has 'of late created and ordained&mdash;in
order to have a copious supply of useful and essential books&mdash;royal
printers in the Latin, Greek, and Hebrew tongues.'<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a></p>

<p>We have not the letters patent of Robert Estienne, but we are more
fortunate in respect to Néobar, for we have the document by which he
was created king's printer for Greek.<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> This curious document, which
does so much honour to François I, well deserves to win oblivion for his
unlucky edict of proscription against printing, rendered January 13, 1535
(new style), which has been invoked against his memory several times in
recent years, although it was never put in execution. On Néobar's death
in 1540, Robert Estienne succeeded him as king's printer for Greek, retaining
the title for Latin and Hebrew.</p>

<p>The king's fondness for the classics did not lead him to neglect the
French language: in 1539 he promulgated a celebrated ordinance, to the
effect that 'henceforth all decrees, etc., shall be pronounced, recorded, and
delivered to the parties concerned, in the mother tongue.'</p>

<p>In 1541, Olivier Mallard, who had acquired all of Tory's typographic
paraphernalia, published a book of Hours of the Virgin, in Latin, octavo,
with the borders 'à la moderne' to which I referred on page 25. It is
copied doubtless from the edition put forth by Tory about 1530, which
I have never been fortunate enough to see. Of the edition of 1541, I have
seen one copy on vellum, and another on paper. It consists of 23 octavo
sheets (signatures A to Y), and has on the title-page: 'Horæ in laudem
beatissim. Virginis Mariæ ad usum Romanum.' (Pot Cassé) 'Parisiis, apud
Oliverium Mallardum, sub signo Vasis effracti.&mdash;1541.'</p>

<p>In the following year Mallard published another edition of the Hours
of the Virgin, in quarto, like the one issued by Tory in 1531. I shall speak
of it in detail in its place.<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> Here I will simply say that the book was finished
in the month of August, 1542.</p>

<p>On the twenty-second of the same month, Mallard renewed the lease
of his quarters in the Halle aux Blés de Beauce, which lease had been
given nine years earlier to Tory's widow and Martin Féret, at a rental of
122 livres 10 sous, tournois. The rental was increased for Mallard, who
had to pay 130 livres, plus 4 écus d'or au soleil 'for the time of the said
leasing.'<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> Olivier Mallard did not long enjoy his lease, for he died that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
same year. His last printing, according to La Caille, who writes the name
Maillard,<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> was a translation of the Dialogues of Plato, by Simon de Valembert,
published in 1542. I have been unable to find this book in Paris,
but I have seen another, probably of later date, at the bookshop of M.
Techener; it is entitled: 'Le livre de Ange Bologninus, de la curation des
ulceres exterieurs, traduit de latin en francoys.&mdash;Paris, au Pot Cassé, en
limprimerie de Olivier Mallard, libraire et imprimeur du roy. 1542.' It
is an octavo of four signatures. As the license is dated December 1, this
little book is probably the last one printed by Mallard, as he was succeeded
in the following year, as king's printer for French works, by Denis
Janot (one of the most skilful printers in Paris), as is set forth in the letters
patent, which will be found in Appendix VII. Appendix VIII contains
a complete list of the king's printers who lived in Paris.</p>

<p>Mallard's typographical apparatus seems to have been acquired by Jean
Kerver, son of the first Thielman Kerver, living on rue Saint-Jacques,<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> at
the sign of the Gril ('sub signo Cratis'), who printed several editions of the
Hours in octavo, with the borders 'à la moderne' used by Mallard in 1541.
The sign of the Pot Cassé, which Kerver did not need, was adopted by a
bookseller of Chartres, named Richard Cotereau, who seems also to have
bought some of Tory's woodcuts representing that mark. In fact I have
seen one, which I have never seen on any of Tory's books, in a book
printed in Paris for Cotereau by Nicolas Chrestien; it is: 'Le Coustumier
de la baronnye, chastellenie, terre et seigneurie de Chasteauneuf en Tymerays';
octavo, 1557. The title-page is an engraving of the Pot Cassé, with
the design reversed,<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> like that of the title of 'Champ fleury,' but signed
with the double cross; and beneath are the words: 'Pour Richard Cotereau,
libraire, demeurant à Chartres, en la grande rue, à l'enseigne du Pot
Cassé.'</p>

<p>Philippe Cottereau, evidently the son of Richard, and king's printer
at Blois, used the same mark. I have seen it on a small book printed by
him in 1603: 'Reglement pour l'instruction des proces qui se conduiront
au bailliage et siege presidial de Bloys.' Two octavo sheets.</p>

<p>It would seem, however, that the sign of the Pot Cassé, which remained
for some time longer on the Halle de Beauce, also remained on the house
originally occupied by Tory, on rue Saint-Jacques, for we find a printer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
named Michel de la Guierche living at that sign. See, among other works,
'M. T. Ciceronis ad M. Brutum Orat.&mdash;Paris, apud Mich. de la Guierche,
sub signo Vasis effracti, in vico Jacobeo.' Quarto, without date, but with
documents of 1542 and 1543.<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> But the Pot Cassé itself does not figure in
his books.</p>

<p>Tory's widow seems to have retained his engraving establishment for
a considerable further time. Although engrossed by her numerous undertakings,
she found time nevertheless to have some of her husband's books
reprinted, and among others the 'Sommaire de Chroniques d'Egnasius,'
in 1541, 1543, 1544, for the bookseller Charles L'Angelier, and 'Champ
fleury,' in 1549, for the bookseller Gualtherot. I say that she had these
books reprinted, but I ought rather to say, perhaps, that she allowed them
to be reprinted, for there is nothing to suggest her coöperation in the
work. Literary property did not then exist.</p>

<p>In the new edition of 'Champ fleury,' which by the way no longer
bears that graceful title, the Pot Cassé does not even appear, although
the explanation of the mark is allowed to remain. It was doubtless a bookseller's
speculation.<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> However that may be, this reprint forms an octavo
volume of 160 leaves (the folio has 80), in addition to the preliminary
matter, of which there are 16 leaves (8 in the folio); it is entitled: 'L'Art
et Science de la vraye proportion des Lettres Attiques, ou Antiques, autrement
dictes Romaines, selon le corps et visaige humain, avec l'instruction
et maniere de faire chiffres et lettres pour bagues d'or, pour tapisserie,
vitres et painctures. Item de treize diverses sortes et façons de lettres;
d'avantage la maniere d'ordonner la langue françoise par certaine regle
de parler elegamment en bon et plus sain langage françois que par cy-devant,
avec figures à ce convenantes, et autres choses dignes de memoire,
comme on pourra veoir par la table, le tout inventé par maistre Geoffroy
Tory de Bourges.'</p>

<p>I have copied this long title at full length only to give myself an opportunity
to call attention to the progress that had been made by French
typography since the day when Geofroy Tory published his first edition,
and, indeed, as a result of that same publication. We find here the accents,
the apostrophe and the cedilla, upon the absence of which the author had
commented in 1529. So that we may say that the whole grammatical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
portion of his book had become useless as a direct result of the first edition
of that book. This is a fact to which the editors of the second edition paid
no heed, as they allowed Tory's observations to stand as they were written,
while introducing into their text the novel signs I have just mentioned.
For instance, they repeat that <em>c</em> has two sounds, one hard, as in
'coquin,' etc., the other soft, as in 'françois,' etc. But by adding the cedilla
in the last word they destroy the sense of the criticism made by Tory
in 1529.<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a></p>

<p>It does not appear by whom the book was printed; we learn only on
the last leaf that it was finished August 26, 1549, 'pour Vivant Gualtherot,
libraire juré en l'Université de Paris, en la rue Saint-Jacques, à
l'enseigne de Saint Martin.'</p>

<p>In order to adjust Tory's woodcuts to the smaller format, they were
somewhat mutilated; indeed some of them were omitted altogether,
among the number those representing the Pot Cassé, which probably
remained in the possession of Olivier Mallard or his successors, and which
it was not deemed essential to have engraved anew for this reprint, for
it was executed as cheaply as possible, and as if for the purpose of utilizing
such woodcuts as remained at the disposal of Tory's widow.<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a> The
work was subjected to some further modifications in this edition. For
instance, all dates were suppressed in the preliminary matter, which also
was arranged in a different order. Even the license granted by François I
was omitted as having become useless; but no change was made in the
actual arrangement of the work, nor was there a single addition or emendation.</p>

<p>Thus Tory, at his death, was able to flatter himself that he had contributed
materially to the improvement of his mother tongue, which he
loved so well. He died, as I have said, in 1533, and not in 1550, as is erroneously
stated in a poetical epitaph composed nearly a century after our
printer's death, by his compatriot, Nicolas Catherinot, at the request and
from the notes of Jean Toubeau, himself a printer of Bourges, and a descendant
of Tory, through his mother.</p>

<p>Here is the epitaph, as given by La Caille:<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a>&mdash;</p>

<p>The only relic that we have of Tory to-day, outside of his books and
works of art, is a volume from his library, as his signature in the genitive
case indicates. It is a manuscript on vellum, containing the orations of
Cicero against Verres, in Latin. This volume was acquired, presumably
after Tory's death, by his patron Jean Grolier, who wrote his motto at
the end of the text: 'Joannis Grolierii Lugdunensis et amicorum.' From
the library of this illustrious bibliophile, the manuscript passed to Colbert's
library, then to the king's. It is preserved to-day [1857] in the Bibliothèque
Nationale. We give below a facsimile of Tory's signature, which
appears on the first flyleaf:&mdash;</p>

<p>This mark is found only at the end of the little poem written by Tory
on the death of his daughter, which was published February 15, 1524,

<p>This mark, which differs from the preceding only in the omission of the
little figure in the clouds, appears on the last page of the Hours of 1524-1525

<p>This mark appears on the title-page of the Hours
(quarto) of 1527. It was used by Jean Mallard,
bookseller at Rouen, 1542.<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a> (Silvestre, no. 604.)</p>

<p>I have never as yet seen this
mark in any book of Tory's;
but I have found it in books
published by Richard Cotereau,
bookseller at Chartres,
in 1557, and by Philippe Cotereau,
bookseller at Blois, in
1603. (See p. <a href="#Page_41">41</a>, supra.) The
presence of the Lorraine cross
is, it seems to me, a sufficient
proof that it should be attributed to Tory.
(Silvestre, no. 929.)</p>

<p>We have already observed that Tory was not only a bookseller and
printer, but a binder as well. To complete the list of our artist's professional
acquirements an example of the toolings that he used to decorate
the covers of some of the volumes bound by him, is reproduced [on the
cover of the present volume.<a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a> The reproduction is from the cover of a copy
of the works of Petrarch, printed at Venice in 1525, and now preserved
in the Library of the British Museum.] The Pot Cassé, in its simplest form,
appears among the arabesques of this binding. Tory had also had engraved
a larger plate of the same, for use on the binding of quartos, or, rather,
of folios. The design is almost identical. Sometimes the Pot Cassé is accompanied
by the drill. This design appears on a copy of Macault's translation
of Diodorus Siculus, printed as late as 1536, 'au Pot Cassé.' This
beautiful volume, in M. Didot's magnificent library, is sufficient proof
that Tory's widow continued his various industries for a considerable time.</p>

<p>It is hardly necessary to say that the same tools could, with some slight
additions, be used in binding volumes of all sizes, from the octavo up.</p>

<p>Here, then, you have, most illustrious Philibert, Pomponius Mela,
purged of the many errors in which he abounded. I took the trouble to
put him in the hands of a very careful printer, one who was, besides, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
first Parisian to give to the Greek characters a form of superior elegance.
I have been pleased to revise the text with special care and to add a very
few annotations, so that, when it should come into your hands, and later
on into the hands of the public, it might come in a more polished and
finished form. You, now, with Mela in hand, may, like Phiclus, who, as
the story goes, ran over the tops of the grain-fields without breaking the
ears, traverse and re-traverse, not only in security, but confidently and
resolutely, the whole world. If you wish to lay hold of tigers, swiftest of
animals, and to see from a safe vantage the catoblepas, if you wish to
meet dragons and wild beasts, Satyrs, Pans, and Silvani, if you wish to see
the Indians, 'the Britons, separated by a world between,' the Sauromatae,
the Africans, and all the peoples that lie between these, and learn of
their wonderful habits, then take but this world, I mean Pomponius,
many times in hand, and without doubt you will there be able to see

seems quite proper that I should, with the kind consent of the reader, consider
a very few of the very few mistakes of this book: thus, for example,
where "potuit" is found in the epistle, "possit" should be written.'</p>

<p>Quarto, of 152 leaves of text, preceded by 12 unnumbered leaves and
a folio cut representing the ancient world. On the second preliminary

<blockquote>

<p><em>To the reverend Father and Lord in Christ, Germain de Gannay,
bishop-elect of Cahors, Geofroy Tory of Bourges proffers most humble
greeting.</em><a name="FNanchor_183_183" id="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a></p></blockquote>

<blockquote>

<p>I here present, most excellent prelate, in more accurate and emended
form than that in which he has hitherto been read, Pope Pius, an author
who, in his Description of Asia and Europe, is much to be admired both
for the dignity and for the singular worth of his work. In looking for some
one to whom he, in behalf of his book, freshly issuing from the printing-office,
might straightway most devotedly offer his respects, some one
select, devoted to letters, and possessed of the highest virtue, I could think
of no one more to be desired, more worthy than you. That the Supreme
Pontiff himself should go to visit you, a most venerable bishop, seemed to
me a thing not without humour. That he, I say, who was a meritorious
writer of geography, and, as you will be able to see, of history well deserving
to be read, should come and embrace you, lover and cultivator of every
form of polite literature, I thought a thing very appropriate. It was like
setting the gem to the gold, or the 'encaustum,' that is picture drawn with
fire, to the silver, it was like conferring the palm upon the victor; and that
most certainly is nothing other than to join the good to the good, the glorious
to the glorious, the deserving to the deserving. But along with these
reasons there is still another reason why to you of all persons this most
illustrious work should very properly be dedicated: it was at your instance
and suggestion that I divided the work into chapters and gave to its parts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
a more convenient arrangement. That you first, and then that all other
students and readers, may, as was your wish, find and remember the parts
of the earth, which are many in number, and the things in them that are
interesting to know about, more easily and conveniently, I have divided
the book thus: the names of rivers, towns, places, rulers, and other important
matters I have put in separate chapters and marked with marginal
captions; these names are also all to be found, provided with numbers,
in the index. This little work of mine, therefore, I dedicate to you,
my lord, in deepest reverence and with sincere feeling. It is certainly
far from being what I should offer to so reverend a father, but you,
whose goodness and integrity, which are perfectly evident to me, all
praise in the highest terms, will, if it so please you, take the book into
your most pure hands and bestow upon it the favour which you are accustomed
to bestow upon works of this kind. Farewell.</p>

<p>Paris, at the College of Plessis, 2 Oct., <span class="smcapa">A.D.</span> 1509.</p></blockquote>

<p>Next comes a 'table,' which fills eleven leaves, on the verso of the last
of which we find the following note to the reader:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="center"><em>Geofroy Tory of Bourges to the Reader.</em><a name="FNanchor_184_184" id="FNanchor_184_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a></p>

<p>You will find the words 'eruȩre, contendȩre, misȩre,' and many others
of the same sort, written with an <em>ȩ</em> in the penult: this was done in order
that the perfect indicative, which regularly has a long penult, might
show its quantity (which you are to utter in reading), as distinguished
from that of the present and past imperfect infinitive, which in the third
conjugation always shortens its penult. It is with pleasure that I have
imitated and adopted the very elegant and finished form of writing which
is used in the 'Psalterium Quincuplex,'<a name="FNanchor_185_185" id="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> recently published. You will also,
though rarely, find this <em>ȩ</em> used, after the fashion of certain authors, for <em>æ</em><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
in some words, and similarly at times in the genitive and dative singular,
and in the nominative and vocative plural, of the first declension. I have
furthermore written designedly 'mistum' with an <em>s</em> instead of an <em>x</em>,&mdash;for
'misceo' makes its perfect 'miscui,' whence by analogy 'mistum,'&mdash;'intellego,'
'toties,' 'quoties,' 'litus,' 'opidum,' 'litera,' 'tralatum,' 'aliquando,'
and other similar forms, which are to be written according to
ὀρθογραϕία, that is to say, correct spelling. The word 'Turca' also, which
many make in the second declension, I have written in the first. I follow
herein with approval Michael Tarchaniota Marulus of Constantinople in
his lines addressed to Charles, King of France. These are his words: 'Invincible
king, scion of the race of Charles the Great, whom the holy prophecies
of so many men, of so many gods, demand as the vindicator of fallen
justice and loyalty; whom here the sad Ausonian land, there Greece with
streaming locks, calls, and whate'er of Asia and wealthy Syria the cruel
Turk profanes,' etc.</p>

<p>In writing the accusatives 'plureis,' 'parteis,' 'omneis,' 'monteis,' in '<em>eis</em>,'
I have believed that I was writing good grammar and good Latin, following
therein Priscian, book 7, the chapter on the accusative plural of the
third declension. This form is valuable for distinguishing the accusative
from the nominative, and has been used by a thousand authors, of which
great number it is sufficient at present to cite as witnesses Sallust, Virgil,
and Plautus. Sallust, who used the first word also, says in the Catilinarian
War: 'Omneis homines qui sese,' etc. Virgil in the first Æneid: 'Hic
fessas non vincula naveis Ulla tenent....' Plautus in the Aulularia: 'Quid
est? quid ridetis novi omneis, scio fures hic esse complureis.' I have been
pleased to make this explanation, good reader, so that you not only might
know what pure speech is, but also, both in reading and in speaking,
might have pleasantly at hand, like finger-posts, and might use, pure
words. Farewell.</p>

and his memory, it seems to me, should be forever honoured and kept
green. He is reported, as the saying is, to have toiled not only by the lamp
of Aristophanes, but by that of Cleanthes as well.<a name="FNanchor_191_191" id="FNanchor_191_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a> You do not doubt that
he is deserving of praise for the elegance of his song; whence it happens
that there is a religious poem of his written on the Passion of Our Lord,&mdash;a
poem of such brilliancy, such sweetness, such ornateness, that one
could believe it to be the work of the divine, rather than of a human,
mind. I do not doubt that, as a result of this fact, the same thing will fall
to his lot that usually falls to the lot of literary men: as Claudian says,
'His presence will diminish his fame.'<a name="FNanchor_192_192" id="FNanchor_192_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a> Not, however, without Theseus,<a name="FNanchor_193_193" id="FNanchor_193_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>

<p>The little book comes to an end with the poem by Lactantius mentioned
on the title-page. It fills the third and second last leaves, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
recto of the last, at the foot of which we read: 'Finis. Ex ædibus Ascensianis

<p>M. Jules de Saint-Genois, librarian of the University of Ghent, writes
me as follows concerning his fellow-townsman, the author of the verses
on the Passion:&mdash;</p>

<p>'The name of the person in whom you are interested was not le Riche,
but de Rycke, in Flemish, which in the Latin rendering becomes Dives.
This is what Sanderus says of him in "Flandria Illustrata," 1, 386 (edition
Hagæ-Comitis, 1735): "Gulielmus Dives, vulgo de Rycke, Gandavensis
poeta: ejus exstat 'Carmen elegiacum de Passione Dominica,' artificiosæ
pietatis plenissimum, quod inter illustrium poetarum opera impressit
Judocus Badius Ascensius Parisiis."</p>

<p>'Valère André, too, devotes a few lines to him in his "Bibliotheca Belgica"
(Lovanii, 1623, p. 344): "Elegiam de Passione Dominica edidit Antverpiæ
cum Dominici Mancini, Phil. Beroaldi et aliorum similis argumenti
libellis, 1527, Mich. Hellenii typis."</p>

<p>'P. Hofmann Peerlkamp says in his "Liber de vita, doctrina et facultate
Nederlandorum qui carmina latina composuerunt" (2d edition, Harlem,
1838, p. 29): "Gulielmus Dives Gandensis floruit 1520. Scripsit 'Carmen
elegiacum de Passione Dominica,' artificiosæ pietatis plenissimum....
Hæc sæpius prodiit, addita etiam <em xml:lang="la" lang="la">uatuor virtutibus</em> Dominici Mancini,
Antverpiæ, a. 1562. Si vocabulum his illic excipias minus latinum, Carmen
est melioris notæ quam multa ejusdem temporis de hoc argumento."</p>

<p>'As for the edition which you mention, said to have been printed "in
ædibus Ascensianis," in 1509, the library does not own it; but Gulielmus
Dives' little poem is printed in "Dominici Mancini Poemata," Antverpiæ,
1559, 12mo.'</p>

<p>This is all that I have been able to learn concerning Guillaume le Riche
or de Rycke; we do not know how this burgess of Ghent became a professor
at Bourges. And yet the fact itself is not extraordinary, for, not long
after, about 1530, another Belgian, named Hanneton, gave instruction in
feudal law there.</p>

<p>Tory published also at the end of his edition of Valerius Probus [see
number 5, infra], the following Latin distich,&mdash;an enigma,&mdash;written by
his master:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>As for Herverus de Berna, Tory's fellow-pupil, I know even less of
him. All that I have been able to learn is that he published in 1543 a
short poem in praise of the dukes of Nevers, lords of Orval near Saint-Amand,
where Herverus was born, and of which he was then curé, if I
read aright his bombastic Latin. This is the title of the book, which was
for sale at the shop of Vivant Gualtherot: 'Panegyricon illustrissimorum
principum comitum Druydarum et Aurivallensium et Nivernensium,
Hervero a Berna, curione Amandino Allifero, auctore. Parisiis, 1543.' (I
fancy that the words 'curione Amandino Allifero' mean: curé of Saint-Amand-l'Allier,
now Saint-Amand-Montrond.)</p>

<p>The work is dedicated to a friend of the author, and perhaps of Tory
as well, named Nicolas Rocheus (La Roche?), described as 'Apollineæ
artis doctor eximius' in the dedicatory epistle, which is dated: 'Tumultuarie,
ex ædibus nostris Amandinis, kalendis ianuarii, 1542.'</p>

<p>This work, which was printed by J. Marchand, at the expense of
Geofroy de Marnef, bookseller and publisher, was prepared for the press
by Geofroy Tory, who placed at the beginning the following letter:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="center"><em>To the most distinguished Philibert Babou, Geofroy Tory of Bourges,

<p>Last year, when I was attending to the printing of Pope Pius's Cosmography,
the idea occurred to me of thoroughly revising and handing
to the printer at an early date the Babylonian Berosus's work on the 'Antiquities
of the Kingdoms'; but, my mind at that time taking another
turn, I determined to postpone this work, for the reason that I had a
project of almost divine character on hand; and indeed I should have
postponed it for a long time,&mdash;as the saying is, to the Greek Calends,&mdash;had
not Berosus himself, so to speak, and, what is and always will be of
no little importance to me, a number of my friends, daily whispering in
my ear, as it were, their prayers, demanded of me most earnestly that
I should print, along with Berosus, Myrsilus 'De origine Turrenorum,'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
Cato's fragments, Archilochus, Metasthenes, Philo, Xenophon 'De æquivocis,'
Sempronius, Fabius Pictor, and Antoninus Pius's fragments of the
'Itinerarium.' There is a very avaricious class of human beings, which,
if it has a book&mdash;a book that is hard to find&mdash;consisting of three or four
short lines, straightway,&mdash;like the ants of India, or the griffins, which
are fabled to carry gold to a remote spot and there keep watch over it,
threatening with dire destruction any one who attempts to touch it,&mdash;carries
it off and guards it, and loading it with chains and fetters, keeps
it imprisoned like a miserable captive. Such people ought to display their
officious greed&mdash;the greed of possessing something unique all to one's
self&mdash;in company with the ants and griffins, which other people avoid,
rather than to continue their incivility, or perhaps I should rather say
immunity, among human beings. We are born not alone for ourselves:
we owe something also to our friends, something to our country. Therefore,
that it may not seem to be my desire to extinguish the brilliant
light of a burning lamp, I the more willingly, under your name, Philibert,
most illustrious citizen of Bourges, send forth Berosus's 'Antiquities,'
together with the other authors mentioned above, for the common study
of all, and I believe that I shall therein be doing an act that will gain the
gratitude, in some small measure, of my country. Farewell.</p>

<p>Paris, at the College of Plessis, 2 May, 1510.</p>

<p>Tory's letter is dated May 2, 1510; but the printing of the book was
not finished until the ninth of that month, as we see by the subscription
of the first edition; for there were at least three distinct editions in Tory's
name, to say nothing of a multitude of others issued by different publishers.
Annius of Viterbo, otherwise known as Jean Nanni, had recently
brought into fashion the fables of Berosus, which he attempted to palm
off as an ancient work; and scholars were still at odds as to the authenticity
of the book, the sale of which their discussions aided to maintain.
Tory seems to have taken sides with Annius of Viterbo, as he himself
prepared an edition of the supposititious Berosus, the preface of which
we have just quoted. We have said that there were three editions in his
name. They may be described thus:&mdash;</p>


<p class="center"><em>First Edition</em></p>

<p>Quarto; 28 leaves numbered in Arabic figures, and 4 preliminary
leaves.</p>

<p>Folio 1 recto, title: 'Berosus Babilonicus, de his quæ præcesserunt inundationem<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
terrarum; item Myrsilus, de origine Turrenorum; Cato, in fragmentis;
Archilocus, in epitheto de temporibus; Metasthenes, de judicio
temporum; Philo, in breviario temporum; Xenophon, de equivocis temporum;
Sempronius, de divisione Italiæ; Q. Fab. Pictor, de aureo seculo
et origine urbis Romæ; fragmentum itinerarii Antonini Pii; altercatio
Adriani Augusti et Epictici.' Then comes the mark of the Marnefs, with
the letters E. I. G., and the words 'Le Pelican' in a scroll at the left. (No.
15 of M. Silvestre's 'Marques Typographiques.')</p>

<p>On the verso of this leaf is Tory's letter, quoted above. Four unnumbered
intercalated leaves follow, containing the table of contents and a list
of errata.</p>

<p>Folio 2, recto: 'Berosus, de his quæ præscesserunt inundationem terrarum.'</p>

<p>The articles mentioned on the title-page follow, up to folio 28, where
we find these words:&mdash;</p>

<p>'Impressum est hoc opus Parrhisiis, in Bellovisu, per Joannem Marchant,
impensis Godofredi de Marnef, anno Domini 1510, septimo idus
maias.<a name="FNanchor_199_199" id="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a>&mdash;<span class="smcapa">CIVIS.</span>'</p>


<p class="center"><em>Second Edition</em></p>

<p>Quarto; 4 unnumbered preliminary leaves, and 30 leaves of text numbered
in roman figures; in all, 34 printed leaves.</p>

<p>On the first of the unnumbered leaves is the title, 'Berosus Babilonicus,'
etc. (as in the first edition), but with the following additional words:
'Vertumniana Propertii. Manethon.' Same mark as in the first edition, but
smaller.<a name="FNanchor_200_200" id="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a></p>

<p>On the second leaf, Tory's letter. On the verso of this leaf the index
begins, and fills the two leaves following.</p>

<p>Folio i. 'Berosus,' etc. The text corresponds with that of the first edition<a name="FNanchor_201_201" id="FNanchor_201_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a>
to folio xxvii, where the additions begin.</p>

<p>Fol. xxvii, recto. End of the 'Altercatio.'<br />
<span class="mleft4"> &nbsp;verso. 'Vertumniana Propertii.'</span><br />
<span class="mleft1"> &nbsp; xxviii, verso. 'Manethonis, prima pars.'</span></p>

<p>Fol. xxx (not numbered), several pieces of verse [not mentioned on the
title-page], perhaps by Tory, but not signed:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. 'Ad reverendissimum ac religiosissimum Arturum Calphurnium,
Sancti Georgii de Nemore antistitem.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>2. 'Ad eruditissimum Nicolaum Corbinum, Vindocinensis plage judicem.'</p>

<p>3. 'Ad bonarum literarum vere amatorem amicum sibi fidelem Philippum
Morinensem.'</p>

<p>This edition, which seems never to have been described by any bibliophile,
is in the Bibliothèque Mazarine, and at Sainte-Geneviève. It was
undoubtedly published in 1511, but it bears no indication of its date.</p>


<p class="center"><em>Third Edition</em></p>

<p>Quarto; 6 preliminary leaves, unnumbered, and 51 leaves numbered
in roman figures, divided into ten signatures (A to K), containing alternately
one and a half and two leaves. In all, 57 printed leaves, and one
blank.</p>

<p>On the first unnumbered leaf is the title: 'Berosus,' etc. (as in the first
edition), but with the following addition: 'Cornelii Taciti de origine et
situ Germanorum opusculum. C. C. de situ et moribus Germanorum.&mdash;Anno
Domini 1511.' Then follows a shocking imitation of the mark of
the Marnefs in the first edition. The gothic initials E and G are changed
to C and O, and the I, which in the other editions stands between the
E and the G, is omitted. The words 'Le Pelican,' in a scroll at the left,
are reduced to the three letters L, P, and A, the foreign artist having
been either unable or unwilling to read what was printed on the copy
put before him, which, it is true, may have been imperfect. The first
decorated letter, also, has been copied, in order to deceive the reader, who,
if we may judge from appearances, was assumed to be seeking the edition
prepared by Tory.</p>

<p>On the second leaf is the letter of the editor, from which the word
'civis,' Tory's device, has been omitted, the foreign printer apparently not
knowing its meaning. The four leaves following are taken up with the
table of contents.</p>

<p>Folio i of the text: 'Berosus,' etc. The text which follows corresponds
with that of the first edition down to folio xxxii (erroneously numbered
xxxiii), which ends with the word 'finis.'</p>

<p>On folio xxxiii recto, the work of Tacitus mentioned above ['Germania']
begins. Next, on folio xliii verso, a work in verse by Conrad
Celtès, the title of which is given above, and on folio xlviii, another work,
in prose, by the same author, with this title: 'Ex libro C. C. de situ et
moribus Norimberge, de Herciniæ silvæ magnitudine, et de eius in
Europa definitione et populis incolis.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>There is nothing to indicate where the book was printed; but everything
leads me to believe that it is a German counterfeit. My opinion is
based upon, first, the stupid imitation of the printer's mark of the first
edition; second, the omission of Tory's device at the end of the letter;
third, the additions, all of which relate to Germany; fourth, the fact that
two of the three known copies of this edition were recently to be found
in the same country. One belonged to Panzer, who has described it in
his 'Annales Typographiques'<a name="FNanchor_202_202" id="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a>; I do not know what has become of it;
a second copy was formerly in the library of M. Bunau,<a name="FNanchor_203_203" id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a> whence it passed
to the Dresden Library; the third is in Paris, in the Bibliothèque Nationale,
which also possesses a copy of the first edition. It was by comparing
the two editions that I discovered the fraud committed by the printer of
the edition of 1511 with respect to the typographical mark. The description
of this mark given by Panzer, with that courteously sent me from
Dresden by the learned bibliographer Herr Graesse, before I was aware
of the existence of the copy of the third edition in the Bibliothèque Nationale,
had utterly baffled such bibliographical knowledge as I possess.
I sought a meaning for the letters inscribed on the mark in the third
edition; of course I could not find any. M. Brunet has since produced a
facsimile of this mark, in the fifth edition of his 'Manuel.'<a name="FNanchor_204_204" id="FNanchor_204_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a></p>

<p>Octavo; 6 printed sheets (signatures A to I). Paris, E. I. G. de Marnef
[1510]. This book was probably printed by Gilles de Gourmont, for we
find in it his unaccented Greek type. It contains two engravings on wood,&mdash;the
mark on the title-page, and a Roman portico farther on. There are
also some small cuts engraved on metal in one of the pieces; but none of
them have any artistic merit, and they cannot be attributed to Tory.</p>

<p>On the verso of the title is the following letter, addressed by Tory to
two of his old college friends, who were at this time personages of note:
the first, Philibert Babou, was secretary and silversmith to the king; the
second, Jean Lallemand, was Mayor of Bourges.</p>

the school, that is, of respectability and true worth, I now, under the
protection of your names, ever to be cherished by me, commit to print
Probus Valerius, a most diligent collector and accurate interpreter of the
old writings and abbreviations which appear, elegantly drawn, on the ancient
coins, tombs, and tablets; glad am I to be of even such small service
to my country, and hopeful that the slight revision to which I have subjected
the work will prove to have been as happily, as it has been carefully,
done. Permit, I beg, an author of exceeding merit to come first of
all into your hands, which are most fitted for every excellence, and then
to go forth brightly and cheerfully into the hands of all other students.

<p>And at the end of the book is this other letter, which gives us to know
that the volume is a collection of fragments of ancient authors.</p>

<p>When I began, I believe under favourable auspices, to print Valerius
Probus, it occurred to me, not wishing a book of one or two codices to be
unsuitable as a manual, to print, along with Probus, several articles well
worth making the acquaintance of. I have added to Probus, Priscian's
treatise 'De ponderibus et mensuris'; likewise Columella's 'Quemadmodum
datæ formæ agrorum metiri debeant'; also Georgius Valla's
'Figuras quæ sub dimensionem cadant'; and, further, some dialogues,
together with some enigmas, carefully collected, as occasion allowed,
from various authors. The enigmas I have designedly left unexplained,
so that, when you come to read them (as Gellius says in book xii, ch. 6),
you may sharpen your wits by trying to puzzle them out.<a name="FNanchor_207_207" id="FNanchor_207_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a> Give your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
attention to them, I beg, good reader, so that I may not, as Plautus enigmatically
observes in the 'Miles,' throw dust in your eyes. Farewell.</p></blockquote>

others in this volume of miscellanies.<a name="FNanchor_208_208" id="FNanchor_208_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a> It contains also several pieces of

<p>Such is the complete title of an edition of Quintilian's 'Institutes,'
produced by Tory, in 1510, at the request of Jean Rousselet, of Lyon.<a name="FNanchor_211_211" id="FNanchor_211_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a></p>

<p>This is a large octavo volume, printed in italic (without pagination),
composed of 46 quarto sheets (signatures A to ZZv): there are several
passages in Greek type of excellent appearance, but without accents.
Undertaken at the request of Jean Rousselet, and printed at his expense,
this book probably was not put on the market. In fact it bears no bookseller's
nor any printer's name. We should not even know where it was
printed, were it not for the fact that the dedication, dated the third of
the Calends of March,<a name="FNanchor_212_212" id="FNanchor_212_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a> states that the manuscript was sent by Tory from
Paris to Lyon. At the end of the volume we find these words only: 'Impressum

<p>Everybody knows, most estimable of men, that our forefathers, contented
with their own goodness, practised in the olden times a kind of
architecture that had in it little art and little elegance. Satisfied with
mediocrity, they built and inhabited houses and dwellings of no great
cost or splendour. Matters have finally reached the point that now, men's
intelligence having somewhat awakened, new buildings are everywhere
being erected which have considerable celebrity. In fact, beginning
with the time when the magnanimous King Charles VIII, who was the
terror of all Italy, returned, victorious and crowned with glory, from
Naples, architecture, certainly a beautiful art, began, not only in its Doric
and Ionic forms, but also in its Italian form, to be practised with great
elegance throughout this country of France. At Amiens, at Gaillon, at
Tours, at Blois, at Paris, and in a hundred other well-known places, one
may now see striking buildings, public and private, in the ancient style
of architecture. One may now, I say, see many buildings of such beauty
and so nicely carved that the French actually seem, and are generally
considered, to surpass, not only the Italians, but also the Dorians and the
Ionians, who were the teachers of the Italians. Notwithstanding the brilliancy
of these performances and these artists, I have thought it best to
offer gratefully, and carefully to add, a contribution of some worth. Leo
Baptista Albertus, a writer on architecture who is trustworthy and
familiar with his subject, was lying stored away in my house as if in his
last sleep. It seemed to me that he thoroughly deserved to be printed in
France just at this time, for the delight and benefit of other famous artists
who are better than he. It seemed to me, I say, that he thoroughly deserved
to be printed, and for this reason especially, that the ten books,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
of which the whole work consists, have been divided into chapters. These
chapters were accurately and carefully arranged by Robertus Duræus
Fortunatus,<a name="FNanchor_214_214" id="FNanchor_214_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a> a man of education and culture, who was the Head of his
College of Plessis at Paris four years ago when I taught there, and they
were generously given to me by him to be copied. I copied them, and I
furthermore polished up the whole work and cleared it of all the errors
possible; I wrote the gist of the text on the margin, and gave the work
to the printer to be printed. Permit, I pray, most distinguished citizens
of Bourges, that this excellent work come auspiciously into the hands of
all good artists and students, and that it be handled and read under the
protection of your names ever to be cherished by me. Farewell, you who
are the support and the most distinguished glory of your country.<a name="FNanchor_215_215" id="FNanchor_215_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a></p>

<p>The 'Itinerarium,' most illustrious of men, which for many years had
lain in almost entire neglect, I first received four years ago from a friend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
whom I must ever cherish, Christophe de Longueil, who is beyond question
a scholar of the highest standing in all branches of polite learning.
He gave it to me that I might make a copy of it. It had occurred to me
to send to you from Paris to Tours a copy which, though written in my
own hand, was not wholly without elegance of form. I had given it to a
man to bring to you whose name I purposely spare, but he, regardless
alike of both of us and of his trust, quite shamelessly made a present of it
to some one else. Thus cheated of the fruit of my labour, I was preparing
to make for you another copy, when Longueil himself, who had formerly
brought the original from Picardy, and, as I have said, had given it to me,
having recently come to Paris from Poictiers, urged me to have the work
printed. This I have done, having arranged the names of the towns separately
and in order, and also added in the proper places some matter taken
from another manuscript. I have also made an index, to facilitate the finding
of the name of any town or place in the whole work. Some perhaps
will wonder at the style of the work, and also occasionally in places at the
Latinity. The style, however, will receive sufficient approval from the
student, while the Latinity, in consideration of the early time in which
the work was written, will be condoned by the well-disposed reader. I
should have been disposed to make a number of emendations, using for
the purpose Ptolemy, Strabo, Dionysius, Mela, Pliny, Solinus, and some
others who are not at all to be despised, but out of regard for the venerable
author and in the desire to keep the manuscript, which is very old,
unchanged, I determined to make no alterations. I am waiting for my
friend Longueil to subject it some day to his scrutinizing study, or for
some Hermolaus to apply his exacting file. One thing there is here which
I shall not hesitate to touch: the author's name in the manuscript was, in
my judgement, wrong, for it is written 'Antonius Augustus.' Hermolaus,
a man of culture withal, calls it in a number of places in his Corrections
to Pliny, 'Antoninus.' Those who read will see for themselves. In the
text I have followed the manuscript itself; in the title of the book I have
followed Hermolaus. The fruit of my labour, such as it is, I dedicate, as
in duty bound, to you personally, in a spirit abounding in gratitude. Accept
it, I pray, with the favour with which you are accustomed to accept
all good things, and allow the studious to pass, under your guidance, with
this Itinerary in hand, through a thousand famous cities. Farewell, most
cultured patron of my studies.</p>

<p>Then comes a letter from the publisher to the reader:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="center"><em>Tory to the Reader, greeting.</em><a name="FNanchor_217_217" id="FNanchor_217_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a></p>

<p>In order, gentle reader, that you may be able to use this 'Itinerarium'
to better advantage, you must be advised that whatever you find marked
with a red virgule was larger in number in the old manuscript than in
the other which is more recent. Words which had a different reading in
the recent manuscript have small red letters printed above in the proper
places. Whenever the sign (&#708;) occurs between words, a word or number
should be marked above or at the side by the same sign. The sign 'mpm.,'
so written, also frequently occurs in the text, and signifies 'milia plus
minus.' It was written thus so that the reader might not be wearied by
the frequent repetition of the long form. In the index you will sometimes
find the letter <em>b</em> alone, either following or between the page-numbers:
this signifies that the word in question is found at least twice on the same
page. Pay attention, therefore, and kindly see to it that in case you notice
any who are displeased with my work, you may say to yourself with reference
to them that Persian saying: 'that they may see virtue, and pine
away leaving it behind.' I write this because at the time of printing there
were some who, understanding nothing of this sort, condemned the matter
according to their usual practice. Farewell and live long in happiness.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcapa">CIVIS</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p>Next to this comes a summary of the life of Antoninus, and, lastly,
some verses by the Burgundian Gérard de Vercel, in laudation of Tory
and against poor printers. Here are the verses:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Therefore hence, away therefore, profane hands of the inauspicious
throng of printers; your impure works be off; that by your forbidden
coming and impious front you may not stain and soil this heavenly thing.
Let no man fail to know: this volume is sacred.</p>

<p>Ah! vile and wretched printers, unskilled to put in print even the trifles
of the schools or old women's tales, why do you spoil arts that are
holy, and pollute with impure hand the laborious works of the nine<a name="FNanchor_219_219" id="FNanchor_219_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a>

<p>These few corrections, excellent reader, I beg you not to wonder at.
I have collected them, such as differ from the readings of the old manuscript,
so that you may be able readily to emend the book for yourself.
I should lay the burden of the errors on the printers, but the art of printing
has this natural peculiarity, that the smallest book cannot be printed
from beginning to end without some mistakes. Farewell.</p>

<p>These verses of Tory on the death of his daughter Agnes form a small
volume of two quarto sheets (or eight leaves). The book is dedicated to
Philibert Babou; it was printed February 15, 1523, old style (1524), a few
days after Tory had conceived the idea of his 'Champ fleury' (January 6,
1524). The printer, who is not named, was Simon de Colines, then living
near the School of Law ('e regione scholæ decretorum').</p>

<p>On the last page appears a mark engraved specially for this little book,
for it includes a tiny winged figure ascending heavenward, which doubtless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
represents the soul of Tory's daughter returning to God. This mark
reappears at the end of the Hours of 1524-1525, but minus the small figure
just mentioned.<a name="FNanchor_223_223" id="FNanchor_223_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a></p>

<p>As we learn from the text, Agnes, who died August 25, 1522, at the
age of nine years eleven months and thirty days, was born August 26,
1512. So that Tory was married at least as early as 1511. We know from
another document that his wife's name was Perrette le Hullin.</p>

<p>The only known copy of this little volume, the text of which I reproduce
in extenso, belonged [in 1865] to M. Joachim Gomez de la Cortina,
Marquis de Morante, who was so exceedingly kind as to send it from
Madrid to Paris, that I might examine it at my leisure. M. de la Cortina
has described it in the fifth volume of the catalogue of his library (Madrid,
1859; octavo). My only previous knowledge of it was derived from
that catalogue, although it was bought of M. Techener not more than
ten years ago, for 80 reals (20 francs).</p>

<p>Go, book, to the sacred sanctuaries of pious poets; you are light, polished,
radiant, and neat. Splendidly arrayed you are, and have nard, and
roses, and saffron; the Latin goddesses, gracious divinities, together with
Phœbus. Be not afraid lest you do not carry with you the favour of the

<p class="center"><em>Agnes Tory, sweetest and most modest of maidens, addresses the

<p>Thou who passest with light foot, beloved wayfarer, stay thy step a
little; lo, I wish to say a few words to thee. Live in remembrance of
death, free from vices, and, if thou art wise, cast aside that hope of life
which thou cherishest. Thou art radiant with beauty to-day, but, when
the thread is cut, impious Fate hurries thee straight on to nought. I know
this by experience, for, lately but a young girl of ten, I was suddenly
snatched away. Like a rose I bloomed, sharer in those virtues which are
usually seen in tender maidenhood. But yet I died, overwhelmed by the
cruel fates, and now I am food for the flesh-eating worms. Food for the
flesh-eating worms I lie, but not so wholly lifeless that I cannot speak
the truth to thee. I speak in the Latin tongue, and this is not strange, fair
friend, for I am to be named the daughter of a pious poet. Desiring to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
instruct me in the Ausonian tongue, and also to render me accomplished
in the polite arts, he, like a most affectionate father, teaching me night
and day, himself laid the foundations, sweet and ample, for my life. I
should be accomplished in the learning of the famous Muses, and I should
sing beautiful songs in pleasing measure; and then my sire would have
given me fond kisses, placing the laurel-wreath upon my head. O pitiful
lot of human beings! O hopes doomed to perish! On earth there is nothing
that can be lasting. Not only does death show herself face to face
to wretched mortals, but with silent step she steals upon them secretly
and unbeknown. Ah! beware, therefore, beware, thou who art doomed
to die, the world will certainly in a moment's time fall and crash about
thee. Thou, while thou still livest, while thou seekest great honours, art
with infirm and rapid step steadily approaching thy doom. If thou departest
satisfied with this one certain warning, and if thou believest that
I speak the truth, bestrew me with flowers, violets and lilies, and nard.
Pray for me too, if it please thee, and weep. Me thou wilt cause by thy
prayers to mount to the lofty vault of Heaven, where is perpetual light,
peace, and grateful rest. This was the little that I wished thee to know.
Live in remembrance of death, thou who art destined soon to die. Farewell.</p>

here, weeping in deep distress?</p>

<p><span class="smcapa">MA.</span> I will tell you the truth. I cannot but willingly weep; so nobly
gifted was she in intellect. But ten years of age, having followed her father's

<p><span class="smcapa">G.</span> I wish to converse a little with you here, friend.</p>

<p><span class="smcapa">W.</span> I am willing.</p>

<p><span class="smcapa">G.</span> See how a maiden poet, taken away by cruel fate, is contained in
this earthen urn.</p>

<p><span class="smcapa">W.</span> How old was she?</p>

<p><span class="smcapa">G.</span> Twice five years.</p>

<p><span class="smcapa">W.</span> And did she, well-skilled, sing poetic measures?</p>

<p><span class="smcapa">G.</span> She did.</p>

<p><span class="smcapa">W.</span> 'Tis a wonder that you tell me of.</p>

<p><span class="smcapa">G.</span> She wrote festive songs in sweet verse, spontaneously playing, spontaneously
singing.</p>

<p><span class="smcapa">W.</span> O rare grace of nature! O manifest glory of the gods! That so
tender a maiden should be a poet!</p>

<p><span class="smcapa">G.</span> 'Twas a song, whatever she by chance wished to utter; whatever
she desired to say, 'twas a song.</p>

<p><span class="smcapa">W.</span> Whence came to her the source of such a power?</p>

<p><span class="smcapa">G.</span> From the realms above, whence it is used to come.</p>

<p><span class="smcapa">W.</span> As one divine, therefore, she wrote charming verses?</p>

<p><span class="smcapa">G.</span> As one divine, following her own and her father's precepts.</p>

<p><span class="smcapa">W.</span> Does her father too compose melodies?</p>

<p><span class="smcapa">G.</span> He does, he is a poet fair and proper. He is proper and deft and neat,
bright and decent. He is one whom the Muse blesses with divine song.</p>

<p><span class="smcapa">W.</span> He is certainly well-deserving of some Mæcenas.</p>

<p><span class="smcapa">G.</span> Few are the Mæcenases that live in the French world. No one
to-day either encourages the liberal arts by appropriate gifts or undertakes
to encourage them in any way. Uprightness and fair virtue are in
no esteem. So powerful is the sway of unhappy Avarice. Treachery, deceit,
and vice are in the ascendant. Virtues are put in the background,
and every form of wretched evil creeps abroad.</p>

<p><span class="smcapa">W.</span> What, therefore, does he who is trained by the charming Muses?</p>

<p><span class="smcapa">G.</span> He takes pleasure in being able to live in his own house.</p>

<p><span class="smcapa">W.</span> He ought to go with hurried step to the courts of kings.</p>

<p><span class="smcapa">G.</span> He does not care to, because he has a free heart. Your potentates
sometimes take pleasure in looking at songs, but what then? They requite
them with nods. Golden songs, drawn from the high heavens, they
should reward with jewels and with pure gold. But, frivolous as they are,
they foolishly give their grand gifts to fools, spendthrifts, and rogues.</p>

<p><span class="smcapa">W.</span> Did he educate his own daughter in studies befitting her birth?</p>

<p><span class="smcapa">G.</span> He did, and in the fine arts besides.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcapa">W.</span> And was she earnest to retain her father's precepts?</p>

<p><span class="smcapa">G.</span> She had no greater wish than to follow her father's words.</p>

<p><span class="smcapa">W.</span> Oh, what a great honour she would have been to her country and
her father, had she lived to undertake the duties of life.</p>

<p><span class="smcapa">G.</span> Yes, her glory would have excelled that of all other girls in French
lands. She was distinguished in appearance, her face was beautiful in its
modesty, and she was all compact of golden words and ways. She drew
to herself the hearts of men, young and old, and made them follow her
wishes with constant loyalty.</p>

<p><span class="smcapa">W.</span> This is a miracle you tell me of.</p>

<p><span class="smcapa">G.</span> I tell you the truth, wayfarer. She was a mirror of true-born nobility.</p>

<p><span class="smcapa">W.</span> Oh, overwhelming grief! Oh, bitter grief and pain! That such a
one could die so suddenly! What will her father do in the meantime?</p>

<p><span class="smcapa">G.</span> Bowed down with grief, he will suffer pain of heart and shed unceasing
tears.</p>

<p><span class="smcapa">W.</span> He would do better to pour forth a flood of prayers to the heavenly
gods and to join to his prayers the last rites to the dead.</p>

<p><span class="smcapa">G.</span> He joins the last rites to his prayers and never ceases. He fills the
customary hearths with tinder and fire.</p>

<p><span class="smcapa">W.</span> O maiden worthy of so deserving a father! O father, too, blessed
in such a daughter!</p>

<p><span class="smcapa">G.</span> She now shines benign in the glad clouds, like a radiance newly-risen,
like a golden constellation.</p>

<p><span class="smcapa">W.</span> May she triumph, shining in the ethereal realms, and may the
daughter graciously take her father with her.</p>

<p><span class="smcapa">G.</span> Go about your affairs, if you will depart, wayfarer. This is what I
wished to say. Friend, farewell.</p>

<p><span class="smcapa">W.</span> Live in happiness, guardian of the tomb and revealer of the urn.
I go about my affairs diligently and in haste.</p>

'à tous vrayz et deuotz Amateurs de bonnes lettres,' beginning thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>'Poets, orators, and others learned in letters and sciences, when they
have made and composed some work of their studious diligence and their
hand, are wont to make gift thereof to some great lord of court or church,
commending him by letters and by words of praise to the knowledge of
other men; and this in order to please him and to the end that they may
be able always to be so welcome in his sight that he shall seem to be
obliged and bound to give to them some great gift, some cure or some
office, in recompense of the toil and night-watches they have employed
in the making and composing of their said works and gifts. I could readily
do the same with this little book; but, considering that, if I should give
it to one rather than to another, there might arise envy and detraction,
I have thought that it would be well and wisely done of me to make of
it a gift to ye all, O ye devout lovers of goodly letters! nor to prefer the
great to the humble, save in so far as he loves letters the more and is the
more at home in virtue.'</p>

<p>Then comes a table, filling eight pages, and another letter of Tory,
from which we make a few extracts.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="center"><em>To the readers of this book, humble greeting.</em></p>

<p>It is commonly said, and truly said, that there is great natural virtue
in plants, in stones, and in words. To offer examples would be superfluous,
so certainly is it true. But I would that God might be pleased to give me
grace so to prevail by my words and entreaties that I may persuade some
persons that, if they will not do homage to our French tongue, they will
at the least cease to corrupt it. I find that there be three sorts of men
who strive and exert themselves to corrupt and debase it: they are the
'skimmers of Latin,' the 'jesters,' and the 'jargoners.' When the skimmers
of Latin say: 'Despumon la verbocination latiale, &amp; transfreton la
Sequane au dilucule &amp; crepuscule, puis deãbulon par les Quadrivies &amp;
Platees de Lutece, &amp; comme verisimiles amorabundes captiuon la beniuolence
de lomnigene &amp; omniforme sexe feminin,'<a name="FNanchor_226_226" id="FNanchor_226_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a> it seems to me
that they make sport not of their fellows alone, but of themselves. When
the jesters, whom I may fairly call 'slashers [dechiqueteurs] of language,'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
say: 'Monsieur du Page, si vous ne me baillez vne lesche du iour,
ie me rue a Dieu, &amp; vous dis du cas, vo⁹ aures nasarde sanguine,' they seem
to me to do as great harm to our language as they do to their coats, by
slashing and destroying with contumely that which is of more worth
whole than when maliciously torn and defaced. And in like manner
when jargoners<a name="FNanchor_227_227" id="FNanchor_227_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a> make their remarks in their malicious and wicked jargon,
it seems to me not only that they prove themselves dedicate to the
gibbet, but that it would be well if they had never been born. Although
Master François Villon was in his day mightily ingenious therein, yet
would he have done better to have essayed to do some other more goodly
thing.... I consider moreover that there is another sort of men who
corrupt our language even more: they are the innovators and forgers of
new words. If such forgers are not villains, I deem them little better.
Think you that they show great refinement when they say after drinking
that they have 'le Cerueau tout encornimatibule &amp; emburelicoque
dũg tas de mirilifiques &amp; triquedondaines, dung tas de gringuenauldes
&amp; guylleroches qui les fatrouillēt incessammēt?' I would not quote such
foolish words, were it not that my scorn in thinking of them forces me
to do it. 'Si natura negat, facit indignatio versum....'</p>

<p>Yours in everything,</p>

finished the fifth day of October, in the year above named.'</p>

<p>On the third leaf is the dedicatory epistle, the essential part of which
is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="center"><em>Geofroy Tory of Bourges doth say and give humble greetings to all
studious and true lovers of excellent pastime in reading.</em></p>

<p>Horace, a poet of old surnamed Flaccus, hath told us in writing in
his 'Ars Poetica' that philosophers and poets are wont, under the outer
bark of deceitful words, to convey a moral meaning which may profit
us in the knowledge of virtue or give us pleasure in the charm of their
style and their pleasing invention. Wherefore, seeing this to be true, and
reading all day the Table of the ancient philosopher Cebes, likewise
the Dialogues of the very learned and graceful Greek author Lucian,
methought that it would be well done of me to translate them into our
French tongue also, and cause them to be printed, to the end that each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
one of you, upon reading the said Table, may readily recognize what pure
virtue is, and may find honest pleasure in the ingenious and moral Dialogues
of the said Lucian. I offer them with a most humble and devout
heart to you, O scholars and lovers of pure worth! giving you to know
that, in so far as it hath been possible for me so to do, I have followed
the true text, adding nothing of my own thereto, neither using nor misusing
any modification or stuffing whatsoever. I have most gladly written
them down for you in flowing language, in your domestic mother tongue,
without attempting to mix therein refinements of phrase, strange words,
or such language as Carmentes, mother of Evander, might be unable to
understand or decipher. I see some who, if they should write but six
words, four will be either out of use, or manufactured, or stretched out
longer than a spear. Like him who said in the laments and epitaphs of
a king of the Basoche:&mdash;</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">'Au point prefix que spondile et muscule,</div>
  <div class="i0">Sens vernacule, cartilaige auricule,</div>
  <div class="i0">DIsis acule, Diana crepuscule,</div>
  <div class="i0">Et lheure acculle pour son lustre assoupir.'</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>And a thousand other like sayings which I leave to him. I know not to
whom such language gives pleasure; but to me it seems scarce fair or
fine. It would seem, and yet I misdoubt, as if such a battery of behorned
and overrefined words had come or been hurled down from the Latin
language to ours; for there have been, and there are to this day many
who think that they have done a wondrous thing if they have written
in Latin a strange and unduly long word, like him who said, and ingeniously
none the less: 'Conturbabuntur Constantinopolitani innumerabilibus
sollicitudinibus.' And that other, Hermes by name, who took such
delight in writing long and refined words that he was hoist with his own
petard when another ingenious man composed against him, in manufactured
words, with an armful of syllables, the distich which follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">'Gaudet honorificabilitudinitatibus Hermes,</div>
  <div class="i1">Consuetudinibus, sollicitudinibus.'</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>I say this in passing, that you may not expect to find unwonted words
in this your little book. I know that there was once a wise man and philosopher
who said one day to his friend: 'Loquere verbis presentibus et
utere moribus antiquis,' which is to say, 'Speak in ordinary language
and live according to the manners of the good old days.' In this your said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
little book you will, I think, find charm, for it is full of many goodly
and ingenious conceits both of Cebes and of Lucian. I have placed first
herein, as I have said, the Table of this man Cebes, to the end that you
may see at the outset that 'poesis est pictura loquens': a poetical work
is a speaking picture. Touching the Dialogues of the learned Lucian, I
have not included them all, nor translated all; but I have chosen thirty
only of those which in my opinion are the finest and most moral, which
you may readily discover to be not only pleasant to read, but most profitable
in goodly moral teaching. You will accept them then, if it please
you, with kindly face and heart, remembering that with God's help I
will shortly make you some other new gift, to the best of my ability.
And meanwhile I will pray to our Lord Jesus to have you in his keeping
according to your wishes.</p>

<p>From Paris; in all things your devoted servant,</p>

<p class="center">Geofroy Tory.<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>Follows a long list of errata, and a table of the Dialogues, followed
by another letter, 'aux lecteurs des Dialogues de Lucian contenuz en
ce present livre.' This letter contains nothing personal to Tory, and I
will quote only the closing passage, where, speaking of the Dialogues,
he says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I believe that, if the ancient and noble painter Zeuxis of Heracleia,
if Raphael of Urbino, Michel Angelo, Leonardo da Vinci, or Albrecht
Dürer should try to paint philosophers and their various aspects, they
could not paint them so well nor so to the life as our Lucian paints them
herein. It will seem to you that you do verily see them and hear them
speak, and that Menippus, before your wondering eyes, doth fly up to
heaven to learn the truth concerning all the falsehoods of the said philosophers.
May God have you in his keeping according to your noble and
goodly desire.</p>

<p>From the University of Paris; in all things your devoted servant,</p>

<p class="center">Geofroy Tory.<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>At the end of the book, after the Dialogues, Tory introduced a
number of moral apothegms and plays upon words, probably of his own
invention.</p>

<p>This volume is printed with the type and decorative letters of
'Champ fleury.'</p>

<p>Francoys, by the grace of God King of France, to the Provost of

maistre Geofroy Tory of Bourges, bookseller, dwelling in our city of
Paris, hath caused it to be said and shown to us that he hath of late translated
from the Latin into vernacular French two books, one having been
formerly translated from the Greek into the Latin by several learned and
commendable authors, entitled: 'La Table du philosophe ancien Cebes,
natif de Thebes, et auditeur Daristote,' together with certain moral Dialogues
of Lucian; the other originally composed in the Latin tongue by
Jehan Baptiste Egnace, entitled: 'Summaire de Chroniques, contenant
les gestes et faictz de tous les empereurs Deurope, depuis Iules Cesar
jusques a Maximilian'; likewise another book, entitled: 'Les Reigles generales
de Lorthographe du langaige francoys'; the which books he is
desirous to print, were it our pleasure to permit him so to do, and at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
same time to forbid all booksellers, printers, and all other persons whatsoever
to print, cause to be printed, or expose for sale the said books&mdash;Wherefore
is it that we, having regard to the trouble and labour which
the said Tory hath had herein, have given unto him license and permission
to print, cause to be printed, and expose for sale at a fair and reasonable
price, by himself, his servants, agents and factors, the said books
above described, during ten years following and subsequent to the printing
thereof. Such is our will, etc. Given at Paris the xxviii day of September,
in the year of grace <span class="smcapa">M. D. XXIX</span>, and of our reign the <span class="smcapa">XV</span>.</p>

<p class="center">Heruoet.<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>Next comes the following letter of Tory, by way of preface:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="center"><em>Geofroy Tory of Bourges, to all studious and true lovers of goodly
reading and profitable pastime, doth humbly bid and offer greeting.</em></p>

<p>I promised you not long since, in the preface to the Table of Cebes
and the thirty new Dialogues of Lucian, that I would ere long, by my
humble efforts, make for you another new book, which, to my thinking,
might afford you pleasing and useful pastime, by enticing you to read
and see therein things wherewith your mind might well in due time and
place be entertained and deliciously soothed. At this present time (my
most honourable lords), as your humble servant, who is entirely devoted
to you, I present to you a 'Summaire de Chroniques,' the which I have
translated for you, as I translated the said Cebes and Dialogues, from
the Latin into French, to the best of my poor ability, forewarning you
that, after the manner of Jehan Baptiste Egnatius, the present author,
I have neither modified nor changed the meaning of the story in favour
of any man whatsoever. Nor is my translation made word for word, because
that would have been a too barren style and devoid of charm. I
know that, according to Horace ('nec verbo verbum curabit reddere
fidus interpres'), a translator should not vex his wits about rendering
each word that he translates into a word of his language; but should retain
the meaning and set it forth in the best style that shall be possible
for him. So I have done the best that I could, as well for the love and
respect that I owe you, as not to depart from the pure truth of history,
which is of such nature that it will not brook to be in any way turned
aside from its purity. Marcus Tullius Cicero doth well enjoin it upon us,
when he writes in the second book of his 'Orator': 'Nam quis nescit primam
esse historiæ legem, ne quid falsi dicere audeat, deinde ne quid veri<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
non audeat, ne qua suspitio gratiæ sit in scribendo, ne qua simulatis?'
'But who is there [he says] who does not know that the first law of history
is to dare to tell nothing that is untrue, and to tell the truth without
feigning, to the end that there may be no suspicion of partiality or of
envy in that which one writes?' Of a surety history should be entirely
true, not only for the reasons already given, but because, as Cicero says
a little before the place already quoted: 'Historia est testis temporum,
lux veritatis, vita memoriæ, magistra vitas, et nuncia vetustatis.' 'History
[he says] is the testimony of the times, the torch of truth, the nurse and
life of the memory, teacher and schoolmistress of our life, and messenger
of antiquity.' I have chosen to make you a present of a history, and
a history abridged to the limits of a summary, rather than of something
else, for the reason that while engaging yourselves, you may see therein,
as in a mirror, a thousand excellent things, wherefrom you shall be able
to hear and recognize innumerable useful suggestions which shall do you
good service on occasion in due time and place. Titus Livius says, in the
preface to the first book of his first Decade: 'Hoc illud est precipue in
cognitione rerum salubre ac frugiferum, omnis te exempli documenta
in illustri posita monumento intueri, unde tibi tuasque Reipublicæ quod
imitare cupias, unde fœdum inceptum, fœdum exitu quod vites.' 'It is
[he says] peculiarly good and useful in the knowledge of things, to see
and learn in noble history the teachings of worthy example, by the imitation
and likeness whereof you may choose for yourselves and for your
country that which you ought to imitate and follow, and that which you
ought to avoid as an abomination, at the beginning as well as at the end.'
Take therefore in good part, an it please you, this little work, and accept
it with a gracious face and expression, as of your kindliness you are
wont to do; even so you will invite me, of your courteous and singular
grace, henceforward to do better, with the aid of Our Lord Iesus, to
whom I pray that he will give to you all his love and blessed grace, at
your noble and worthy desire.</p>

<p>At Paris, this <span class="smcapa">X</span> day of April, <span class="smcapa">M. D. XXIX</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p>On the last leaf of the book we find the Pot Cassé, with these words
beneath: 'The printing of this present book was finished at Paris, the
<span class="smcapa">XIII</span> day of April, <span class="smcapa">M. D. XXIX</span>,<a name="FNanchor_232_232" id="FNanchor_232_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a> for maistre Geofroy Tory de Bourges, who

<p>M. Ambroise Didot, who courteously permitted me to examine it at
my leisure. It was in its original binding with the Pot Cassé. The book is
printed in the 'Champ fleury' type.</p>

<p>There are several other editions. I am familiar with two of them, published
by Charles L'Angelier, both in octavo, in 1543 and 1544. M. Hippolyte
Boyer mentions one of 1541, in his 'Histoire des Imprimeurs et
Libraries de Bourges' (octavo, Bourges, 1854), page 27; but I have not seen
it: whereas I have had the privilege of examining the other two. Each
of them contains 112 leaves (signatures A to O), plus 4 unnumbered
ones. The book is illustrated with engravings of two kinds, in addition
to the bookseller's mark on the title-page: the first, reproduced several
times, represents an emperor, mounted, holding a battle-axe; it is not
signed, but is engraved with much delicacy, and embellished with the
little cartouches so much affected by Tory. The others represent busts
of emperors roughly engraved, which cannot be the work of that artist.</p>

<p>Small quarto of 20 leaves with borders, signatures Aij to Cij.</p>

<p>This exceedingly rare little volume has a title-page with a border of
arabesques engraved on wood, with the Lorraine cross. Beneath Tory's
mark are four Latin verses, probably of his composition, as are the six
which bring the narrative to a close and which are entitled: 'Torinus
Biturigicus ad Galliam.' On the verso of the title is the preface, dated
August 25, 1530, and beginning thus: 'Geofroy Tory of Bourges to the
devoted lovers of good reading doth bid and offer humble greeting.'</p>

<p>At the top of leaf Aij we read: 'The order of the grand procession

<p>Octavo; 3 sheets, printed in italic. The title is set in an exceedingly
graceful border, borrowed from the Hours in octavo of 1527. The verso
of the title is blank, and on the second leaf is the following preface:&mdash;</p>


<p class="center"><em>Geofroy Tory of Bourges to the fair reader, greeting.</em><a name="FNanchor_235_235" id="FNanchor_235_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a></p>

<p>There are certain eminent painters in this prolific age, most gentle
reader, who, by their drawings, paintings, and varied colouring, depict the
tribal gods and human beings, as also other things of different sorts, with
such exactness that a voice and a soul seem the only things wanting to
them; but here, most gentle reader, I offer you, nearly in the manner of
these painters, a house, which not only is elegant and finished in its outlines
and parts, but speaks prettily and describes itself part by part in a
eulogy. I also offer you seven epitaphs, composed and written in the ancient
style and in very ancient language. These epitaphs show, in a way
that we may call comprehensible, the various affections to which unhappy
mortals who are in love are subject. I am, I say, pleased to offer you these,
not that you may speak or write in obsolete words such as you here find,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
but that you may have before your eyes, so bright and full of charm,
a sample of antiquity, and may know that you have been thoroughly
warned by me to be on your guard against falling into the snares and
perplexities of an insane love. Farewell.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In addition to the border of the title-page, the book contains seven exquisite
little engravings, corresponding to Tory's seven 'love epitaphs,'&mdash;engravings
which are certainly his, in design at least, although unsigned.
Here is a list of them:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. Two hearts pierced by an arrow.</p>

<p>2. Two hearts in a circle.</p>

<p>3. Two hearts bound together by cords.</p>

<p>4. Two hearts in a boat.</p>

<p>5. A pig sniffing at two hearts.</p>

<p>6. Two hearts, a distaff, etc.</p>

<p>7. Two hearts being kicked by a horse.</p>

<p>As for the text of the book, it has been variously judged. Catherinot
was delighted with it; but the author of the 'Menagiana' reproves Tory
for manufacturing Latin words after the style of the author of the 'Songe
du Poliphile' (see supra, page 55, note 2). We have seen that Tory himself
did not recommend such words to the reader.</p>

<p>After the book treating of the meaning of the ancient letters, called

also the 'Economic Xenophon'; and beneath the shadow of your
most honourable wing, first presenting the same with humble devotion
unto you, I have published the same and placed it in the hands of all virtuous

to find good counsel for directing their families worthily and increasing
their wealth by honest means.</p>

fruitful occupation will kindly take this little book in their condescending
hands, and all will bear you good will, not for the book alone, but for
that you are he to whom all owe honour and service, as to whom all the
public welfare and all Christendom are deeply indebted.</p>

<p>Following this document, which fills three leaves, comes an epistle
from Geofroy Tory of Bourges to 'studious and worthy readers,' by way
of preface. It fills two leaves. The eighth leaf is entirely blank. On the
ninth, the 'Economic Xenophon' begins, and extends from <em>b</em> to <em>i</em> 4; the
fifth and sixth leaves of <em>i</em> contain an 'Epistle from Seigneur Elisee Calense,
native of Amphrates, which he sent to Rufinius, guardian of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>

<p>On the last leaf but one appears a 'duplicate of the license granted to
maistre Geofroy Tory de Bourges, by the King our Sire, for this present
book and others named in this said license,' in these words:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Francoys, by the grace of God King of France, to the Provost of
Paris, Bailly of Rouen, Seneschal of Lyon, and to all other our justiciars
and officials or their deputies, greeting. Our dear well-beloved maistre
Geofroy Tory of Bourges, bookseller, dwelling in our city of Paris, hath
caused it to be made known to us that he hath of late made and composed
in the Latin tongue a certain book entitled; 'Ædiloquium et
Erotica'<a name="FNanchor_237_237" id="FNanchor_237_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a>; likewise, that he hath translated from Greek and Latin into
French the 'Economic Xenophon'; which books he would fain print,
or cause to be printed, if it should be our pleasure to permit him so to do,
at the same time causing all tradesmen, booksellers, printers, and other
persons whomsoever, to be forbidden to print or to expose for sale in any
manner the said books; and that, if any should be brought hither by foreigners,
other than those of the said Tory's printing, they may not be
sold within our realm during the period of the four years reckoned from
the date of the printing of said books, with an extension for a like period
for certain other books, illustrations, and vignettes to be printed in the
'Heures et Office de Nostre Dame' mentioned in two licenses heretofore
granted to him by our favour.<a name="FNanchor_238_238" id="FNanchor_238_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a> Wherefore, having regard and consideration
for the time and toil which it hath cost the said Tory to compile

pleasure to incur in printing the same,&mdash;for these reasons we have given

for sale the said books above mentioned for four years following and succeeding
the printing thereof. And so we command you, that by virtue
of this our present favour, warrant and permission, you do allow the said
petitioner to use and enjoy the same, and do forbid in our name all

<p>On the last page: 'The printing of this present book was finished by
maistre Geofroy Tory of Bourges Wednesday the fifth day of July in the
year <span class="smcapa">M. D. XXXI</span>. And it is for sale at Paris, opposite the "Escu de Basle,"
Rue Sainct Iaques, and opposite the Church of La Magdeleine, at the
sign of the ("a leeseigne [<em>sic</em>] du") Pot Casse.'</p>

<p>The description we have given is that of the very complete copy
owned by M. Ambroise Didot. M. Chedeau, an attorney at Saumur,
owned a copy the title-page of which is different. It reads thus:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

Geofroy Tory, marchant libraire et imprimeur du roy.&mdash;Avec privilege.</p></blockquote>

<p>This title-page has the same border and the same form of the Pot
Cassé as the other copy; but it has not on the verso the little list of
other publications which we find on the latter, and which we have reproduced
above. As the first signature (A) of M. Chedeau's copy lacks four
leaves, we cannot say whether there are other differences in that signature;
but as to the other signatures, B to I, they are identical in the two
copies. Thus we find in both the error to which we called attention above
in the word 'enseigne' [printed 'eeseigne'], in the final note; better still,
this error has been corrected by hand, in the same way, in both copies,
probably by Tory himself. Which of the two is the earlier? I should not
venture to say; however, it seems to me that the additional matter on
the verso of the title-page of M. Didot's copy tends to prove that it is
the later of the two. In any event, the interval between the two impressions
cannot have been a long one. If I interpret rightly certain circumstances,
the first signature, which had been kept in type (as is proved
by a number of typographical defects which appear in both copies), was
reprinted at the same time with the last signature. Tory's dedicatory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
epistle, in M. Didot's copy, is dated July 5, the day when the printing
of the book was finished according to the final note. Now, to make it possible
for him to affix this date to his preliminary epistle, we must concede
that it had been kept in type until the book was finished. But may
it not be that no date was affixed on the first signature of the first impression?
That is a question that I am unable to answer, in view of the
imperfect state of M. Chedeau's copy. It may be, too, that the first signature
was reprinted in order to announce Tory's new address, he having
very recently installed his printing establishment in the famous old Halle
au Blé de Beauce, on Rue de la Juiverie, opposite the Church of La Madeleine.
For it will be observed that this address does not appear on the title-page
of M. Chedeau's copy, although we do find it in the note on the
last page.</p>

remarks. The type and the ornamental letters are the same as in

<p><em>Geofroy Tory de Bourges to his most debonair lord, François de Vallois,

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>My lord, while translating this little book, I have oftentimes reflected to
whom of all my good friends I should the sooner dedicate it, or whether
I should dedicate it (as I have heretofore done with certain other books
which I have composed and translated into the French tongue) to all
studious and genuine lovers of excellent reading and worthy pastime.
But in fine, knowing thy virtuous nature, likewise the mirror of all goodness
and perfect nobility wherein thou dost abundantly excel, and art
ever disposed for every blessed and goodly enterprise, I have considered
that before all other living men, of what state soever they may be, it is
to thy glorious lordship that I ought and am in duty bounden to consecrate
it, since it is thou under whom the public, not of France alone, but
of all Christendom, has its hope of living hereafter in all felicity. I dedicate
it to thee, not forgetting that thou hast thy noble father the King,
who, as Philip of Macedon did of yore to his son Alexander, doth set before
thee noble and goodly instruction and examples of upright living;
but also to the end that thou mayst by times amuse thyself and read the
excellent tales and teachings which are marshalled herein as in a well-chosen
library; and also that, following thy noble and generous example,
the studiously inclined may, by reading the same, worthily profit thereby.
Thou mayst find herein many excellent passages, which will sometimes
help to comfort thee, and will be in some degree the means whereby
thou and thy Realm, with the grace of God, wilt ever prosper more and
more.</p>

<p>Paris, this <span class="smcapa">XIIII</span> day of June, <span class="smcapa">M. D. XXXII</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p>On the verso of the last leaf: 'The printing of this present book was
finished Saturday the <span class="smcapa">XV</span> day of June, <span class="smcapa">M. D. XXXII</span>, by maistre Geofroy
Tory of Bourges, bookseller and king's printer, living in Paris, opposite
the church of La Magdeleine, at the sign of the Pot Casse.' [Here the
Pot Cassé, no. 9.]</p>

<p>I have seen two copies of this book, one in M. Didot's library, the other
in M. Alkan's.</p>

<p>Another edition was published at Lyon, in 1534, in 16mo, by Guillaume
Boulle (or Boullé, for the name, in accordance with the custom
of the time, has no accent on the <em>e</em>). This is undoubtedly the one mentioned
by Duverdier<a name="FNanchor_240_240" id="FNanchor_240_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a> as having been printed at Paris, in octavo, in 1530,
by Guillaume Boullé. In this statement there are as many errors as there
are words. Guillaume Boullé's edition was not printed in Paris, it was not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
an octavo, and it cannot be dated 1530, as the first edition did not appear
until 1532. Unfortunately La Caille did not take the trouble to verify
Duverdier's statement, and he makes Guillaume Boullé a bookseller-printer
of Paris.<a name="FNanchor_241_241" id="FNanchor_241_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a> Lottin, in his 'Catalogue des Libraries et Imprimeurs
de Paris,'<a name="FNanchor_242_242" id="FNanchor_242_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a> has not failed to copy La Caille, and to mention, under the
year 1530, a Guillaume Boullé, bookseller and printer in Paris, side by
side with Jean Boullé, bookseller. Was this Jean, whom La Caille calls
simply Boulle, and whom he places in 1543, a kinsman of Guillaume?
I cannot answer. However that may be, here is a full description of the
edition of the 'Politiques' published by the latter. It is a 16mo volume
containing 8 leaves of front matter and 104 of text. On the title-page,
which is embellished by a roughly executed border, are these words:&mdash;</p>

<p>'Politiques ou Civiles Institutions pour bien regir la Chose publ., iadis

<p>On the verso of the title-page is an engraving representing Justice,
with this inscription: 'Justitia in sese virtutes continet omnes.'</p>

<p>On the following leaf is the dedication to the Dauphin.</p>

<p>At the end of the volume is the mark of Guillaume Boullé, or Boulle.</p>

<p>There is a copy of this little book at the Arsenal, and also one in the
Bibliothèque Nationale. The latter lacks the final leaf bearing the bookseller's
mark, which some collector (!) has cut out, to enrich his collection.</p>

<p>Eight octavo leaves, without date of printing or license. This pamphlet
was undoubtedly printed by Tory himself, subsequent to February 22,
1533; for he assumes the title of bookseller to the University, which he
did not obtain until that date. Moreover, the acute accent, the apostrophe
and the cedilla are used therein, and he did not make use of those marks
until 1533. Lucian's 'La Mouche' [The Fly] fills 11 pages; the 'Maniere
de Parler' (an extract from the eighteenth book of Volaterran's 'Philosophy')
3 pages. The first leaf has the title, and, on the verso, a note
'aux lecteurs.' The type used is the same as in 'Champ fleury.'</p>

<blockquote>

<p>L<span class="smcapa">ES REIGLES GENERALES DE LORTHOGRAPHE DU LANGAIGE FRANCOYS.</span></p></blockquote>

<p>Such is the title of a book written by Tory, of which no trace remains.
We do not know even whether it was printed, although it is included
in the license of the first edition of the 'Sommaire de Chroniques' of
Egnasius, dated September 28, 1529. (See page 88.) Doubtless it was the
complement of 'Champ fleury,' from a grammatical standpoint.</p>

<p>It is not known whether this translation was printed. There are in
existence several old translations of Orus Apollo, but they do not bear
Tory's name.</p>

<p>The first page is ornamented with a
special border, which we shall find in
others of Tory's books. The only copy
of this form of the book which I
have had an opportunity to examine,
namely, the one in the Bibliothèque
de l'Arsenal, although it is bound in
paper only, has a beautiful drawing in
miniature which occupies the whole
of this page. It represents two printers
working at a press, and a compositor
in front of his case. None of the
printing has been retained, save the
five lines of the title, 'Horæ,' etc.,
which are enclosed in a scroll hanging
from the upper branches of two
trees which form the frame of the
miniature. I do not know the name of
the fortunate recipient of this gift. One
sees only his initials (R. P.) in a heart
above the press.</p>

</div>

<p>On the verso of the title we find, in
accordance with custom, the table of
Easter Days, etc., from 1523 to 1551.
The border of the page has, in three
small reserved scrolls in the midst of
the arabesques, the words: <span class="smcapa">GEOFROY&mdash;TORY&mdash;SIC
VT NON PLVS</span>, which recur
from time to time on the following
pages. This border is reproduced
on the title-page of each part of the
book.</p>

<p>The license occupies the whole of
both sides of the second leaf, which is
without borders, for a special reason:
it is printed in gothic type of the
period (to imitate the script of the
diploma) and that style of type would
have quarrelled with the antique arabesques
of Tory, whose refined taste
avoided incongruities of that sort.</p>

<p>'Francoys, by the grace of God

Provost of Paris, the Seneschal of
Lyon, and all other justiciars, officials,
or their deputies, and to each of them

appertain, greeting. Our dear and
well-beloved maistre Geofroy Tory,
bookseller, living at Paris, hath now
caused it to be made known and shown

himself a very long time, and hath
made divers great expenditures, and
outlay. Wherefore, and to enable him
to recover a part of the outlay that he
hath made and undergone while employed
in procuring the aforementioned
drawings and vignettes to be
made; and to the end that he may have
the wherewithal to live with more
ease, he hath most humbly caused to
be laid before us his petition and request
that he alone and no other may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>

vignettes and drawings, and do forbid

said vignettes and drawings, on pain of

<p>The third leaf contains some details
concerning the calendar, which begins
on the fourth leaf and ends on the
ninth. The border of the lower part
of leaf Avij is turned upside down.
The Hours begin on the tenth leaf.</p>

<p>The book is a quarto, but the sheets
are folded two by two, after the style
introduced by Pierre Schoiffer himself,
which gives it the appearance of
an octavo. The signatures run from
A to T, which makes eighteen folds,
or one hundred and forty-four leaves.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_b_110.jpg" width="320" height="500" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The engravings consist of sixteen
complete borders, one of which is repeated
on the recto and verso of each
of the first sixteen leaves, embracing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
thirty-two pages of text, after which
the same decorations reappear. They
are composed of arabesques in which,
from time to time, these words appear
at the sides: <span class="smcapa">SOLI DEO&mdash;LAVS&mdash;HONOR&mdash;GEOFROY&mdash;TORY&mdash;NON
PLVS</span>. At the foot of certain pages we
see a crowned F (the first letter of the
king's name), a crowned C (the first
letter of the name of Queen Claude,
daughter of Louis XII), and a crowned
dolphin (daulphin), in allusion to the
title of the king's eldest son. Queen
Claude died before the book was finished,
perhaps even before the printing
was begun; but Tory did not choose to
waste the woodcut of her, so it was preserved
and was used for more than fifteen
years, as we shall see. These three
subjects are reproduced in Dibdin's
'Bibliographical Decameron' (vol. i,
page 99); there are two others in the
same work (vol. ii, page 65). At the
foot of the other pages are arabesques,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
among which we find the Pot Cassé,
no. 2. In the text there are thirteen
large drawings, which harmonize admirably
with the borders. All the illustrations,
or almost all, borders and
drawings alike, are signed with the
Lorraine cross.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_b_111.jpg" width="312" height="500" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The book ends on the recto of a leaf
on the verso of which is this colophon:
E<span class="smcapa">XCVDEBAT</span> S<span class="smcapa">IMON</span> C<span class="smcapa">OLINÆVS</span>
P<span class="smcapa">ARISIIS E REGIONE SCHOLARVM DECRETORVM:
ANNO A</span> C<span class="smcapa">HRISTI</span> I<span class="smcapa">ESV NATIVITATE
M. D. XXV. XVII. CAL. FEBR.</span></p>

<p>This date coincides with January 16,
1525. We have seen that the title-page
bears the date 1524, that is to say, the
year when the book was begun. These
two dates, cited separately, have led
bibliographers astray, and have given
rise to a theory that there are two
different editions of the same book.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_b_112.jpg" width="309" height="500" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Here and there throughout the volume
we find figures in the borders.
These figures are: 16, which appears<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
on the inner side of leaves Ai verso and
Cvij recto and verso; 3, on the outer
side of the border of leaves Aiiij recto
and verso, and Ciiij recto and verso;
10, at the foot of leaf Biij; 12, on the
outer side of the border of leaf Bvi.
Here and elsewhere, to make my descriptions
more clear, these books having
no pagination, I assign signature
letters to the eight sheets of each fold;
but it is common knowledge that they
actually appear on the first four only. I
feel justified in concluding from these
figures that at first certain numbers,
running from 1 to 16, were engraved,
and repeated on each compartment
of the same border, in order to enable
the compositor to assort the pages
properly. Later these numbers were
probably deemed to be of no use and
were cut off. The four that I have noticed,
having inadvertently been left,
were finally removed before the printing
was concluded. The scheme of re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>peating
each border on the recto and
verso of the same leaf was very ingenious,
for it permitted the imposition
of a larger number of pages without
calling attention to the repetition, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
the two similar pages were never seen
at the same time. This required no
more work, for it is very clear that the
borders were not added to the pages
until the very moment of printing, so
that they might not be exposed to the
accidents inherent in the preparatory
handling. M. Willemin has reproduced
several specimens of these borders in
his 'Monuments Français Inêdits' (folio,
1839), page 296.</p>

<p>The book contains, as we have said,
thirteen large cuts (all of which except
the second are signed with the
Lorraine cross). They are as follows:</p>

<p>1 and 2. The Angelic Salutation, in
two plates facing each other.</p>

<p>3. The Visitation of the Virgin, with
the device 'non plus' in a scroll suspended
from a tree.</p>

<p>4. The Birth of Jesus.</p>

<p>5. The Adoration of the Shepherds.</p>

<p>6. The Adoration of the Magi.</p>

<p>7. The Circumcision.</p>

</div>

<p>8. The Flight into Egypt.</p>

<p>9. The Coronation of the Virgin.</p>

<p>10. The Crucifixion of Jesus. This design
has five compartments. In addition
to the Crucifixion, there are bees<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
at work, birds building their nests, a
peasant ploughing a field, and another
shearing sheep. Each of these four is
accompanied by the device 'sic vos non
vobis.'</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_b_116.jpg" width="313" height="500" alt="" />
</div>

<p>11. The Descent of the Holy Spirit
on the Apostles, with the device 'non
plus' on the pediment of a temple.</p>

<p>12. The Penance of David, with the
same device, and the word 'peccavi'
in a scroll suspended from a tree.</p>

<p>13. The Triumph of Death. This last
cut represents Death, armed with a
spear treading on corpses. A crow on
a tree above him has the words 'cras,
cras,' issuing from its beak. At either
side are the devices 'non plus' and 'sic
ut,' on neighbouring buildings.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcapa">II.</span> There are two sorts of copies in
Tory's name. The first are identical in
every respect with those of Colines,
except as to the first page, where, after
the title: 'Horæ ... habentur,' we find
this imprint: 'Parisiis, apud Magistrum<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>

<p>Here the Pot Cassé, no. 3, with the
device 'menti bonæ deus occurrit' at
the top, and 'non plus' at the foot.</p>

<p>There is no date on the title-page,
but there is one on the last page,&mdash;the
same that we find in the copies in
Colines's name (see page 111). I have
seen a copy of this book in the collection
of M. Double, who kindly allowed
me to study it in detail. It is still in its
antique binding, and on the covers,
in large roman letters, is this device,
which is believed to be that adopted
by the unfortunate Dolet:</p>

<p><span class="smcapa">III.</span> Other copies in Tory's name have a title-page in French, with no

a Paris sus Petit pont, ioignant lhostel Dieu, a lenseigne du Pot
Casse.' Then follows the device 'menti bonæ devs occvrrit,' and the Pot
Cassé in the same form as that on the title-page of the preceding number.</p>

<p>The order of the contents of the first signature is here a little different
from that followed in numbers one and two. On the verso of the title
the license begins, set in roman letters, which Tory preferred to the
gothic; it occupies two pages, as in the other copies, but those pages are
supplied with the antique borders. On the verso of the second leaf is
the table of Easter-Days, from 1525 to 1552. It is more conveniently
placed here than on the verso of the title, where it is separated from
the calendar by the license. Advantage was taken of the reprinting of
the first signature to remove the figure 16 from the border of the page
containing the table of Easter-Days, and to set right the lower section
of the border of page A vij recto, which is upside down in the other
copies. The figure 3 was not removed from page A iiij, probably because
the second side of that signature was not reprinted; but the 10 has disappeared
from page B iij, which would seem to show that the second
side of signature B was reprinted. The first side of signature T was reprinted
also, in order to change the colophon on the last page, for which
this is substituted: 'Ces presentes heures a lusage de R<span class="smcapa">OME</span> furent acheuees

book.) This is followed by the mark no. 5, with the two mottoes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
('menti,' etc., and 'sic,' etc.), which accompany that mark on page 43 of
'Champ fleury.' (See supra, p. <a href="#Page_21">21</a>.)</p>

<p>Tory had several copies printed on vellum; I myself have seen one of
them, belonging to the collection of M. Sauvageot.<a name="FNanchor_244_244" id="FNanchor_244_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a></p>

<p>It will be seen from the date affixed to these copies that they were
not printed until the day following the printing of those which bear the
name of Colines; for it is worth noting that the Tuesday, January 17,
is of 1525, and not of 1526 new style, as would have been the case had
the 'use of Paris' been followed. But Tory thought, doubtless, that he
should follow the Roman usage in a book of Hours to the use of Rome.</p>

<p>I imagine that this reprinting of three signatures of the Hours of
1524-1525 was done mainly to direct the attention of the public to
Tory's new establishment 'sus Petit Pont.' And this circumstance leads
me to believe that it was done subsequent to January 17, 1525, for it is
not conceivable that Tory would have left his former address, rue Saint-Jacques,
on the copies printed as late as January 16, if he was to be settled
'sus Petit Pont' on the 17th. He retained that date on the reissue,
although it really took place later, in order to conform to the terms of
the license, which imposed upon the beneficiary the duty of specifying
on the books the date when they were first published, so that the date
of its expiration might be fixed, unless the term should be extended, as
was done in the case of this very book of Hours; witness the license of
'Champ fleury,' dated September 5, 1526. Indeed, my own opinion is that
Tory did not remove to the Petit-Pont until about the date last mentioned.
We shall see that he remained there until 1530, when the installation
of his printing-office required him to take more roomy quarters.
However, when he opened his shop on the Petit-Pont he did not abandon
his place on rue Saint-Jacques, which he still occupied at least as late
as 1531.</p>

<p>M. Niel owns a copy of this book, in which the cuts are coloured in
water-colour, lined with gold. M. Niel thinks that the arabesques are
adapted from those of Raphael in the Vatican, which had lately been reproduced;
the lamented Renouvier, who agreed with M. Niel in attributing
the colouring to Tory, considered it an admirable piece of work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>It will not fail to be noticed, moreover, that Tory calls attention on the
title-page of his copies to the excellent orthography of his book: an additional
proof that this reimpression was subsequent to 1525.</p>

<p>Tory lent his borders and his engravings to several printers, who frequently
removed his mark therefrom. I will mention particularly five
publications of Simon de Colines on the title-pages of which we find
Tory's borders.</p>

<p><span class="smcapa">I.</span> 'Divi Joannis Chrisostomi liber contra Gentiles,' etc.; quarto, 1528.
The title-page is surrounded by one of Tory's borders, with the crowned
F at the foot, and the broad upright section with the two scrolls containing
the words 'Geofroy Tory,' which have been removed.&mdash;There is a
copy of this volume, in vellum, in the library of M. Solomon de Rothschild,
who has kindly sent me this information.</p>

<p><span class="smcapa">II.</span> 'Rodolphi Agricolæ Phrisii de inventione dialectica libri tres, cum
scholiis Joannis Matthæi Phrissemii'; quarto, 1529 and 1538. Border composed
of two broad upright sections, one of which was used in the preceding.
A crowned F at the top, and another broad section at the foot.</p>

<p><span class="smcapa">III.</span> 'Laurentii Vallæ de linguæ latinæ elegantia libri III'; quarto, 1535

<p>I<span class="smcapa">N</span> 1527 Tory published a new edition of his Hours, in one volume, octavo,
printed as before by Simon de Colines, in roman type, with vignettes of
the same sort, but much smaller. There is a copy on vellum at the Bibliothèque
de l'Arsenal; unluckily it lacks the first and last leaves. According
to M. Brunet,<a name="FNanchor_246_246" id="FNanchor_246_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a> to whom M. Tosi, of Milan, sent the description of
a perfect copy, also on vellum, the first page reads: 'Horæ in laudem
Beatiss. Virg. Mariæ ad usum Romanum venales extant Parrhisiis ad insigne
vasis effracti.' And the last: 'Hujusmodi Horæ nuper absoluebantur
a prælo Colineo, die vicesima prima Octobris anno Domini 1527, pro magistro
Gotofredo Torino Biturigico Bibliopola ad insigne vasis effracti Parrhisiis

<p>We give herewith an extract from the license of this new publication,
which license included also 'Champ fleury' and the Hours of 1524-1525:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p>François, by the grace of God King of France, to the Provost of Paris,
the Bailli of Rouen and the Seneschal of Lyon, and to all our other justiciars
and officials and their deputies, and to each of them as to him shall
appertain, greeting. Our dear and well-beloved maistre Geofroy Tory de
Bourges, bookseller, living at Paris, hath now caused it to be made known
and shown unto us that, in order to proclaim, exalt and embellish the
Latin and French tongues, he hath not long since made and composed
a book in prose and in the French language entitled: 'Lart et science de
la deue et vraye proportion des lettres attiques, autrement dictes antiques
et vulgairement lettres romaines, proportionnees selon le corps et visaige
humain'; the which book he hath caused to be placed before us, soliciting
and requesting us to grant unto him leave, permission and license to print,
or cause to be printed the said book, together with certain drawings and
vignettes 'à l'antique and à la moderne'; likewise friezes, borders, crowns
and scrolls; also to cause to be printed books of Hours, in such form and
of such size as to him shall seem good, during the time and term of ten
years, beginning on the day of the printing of said Book and said Hours;
together with an extension for the same term for certain drawings and
vignettes by him heretofore printed.&mdash;We hereby give you to know,
that we, in consideration of the foregoing, generously acceding to the
petition and request of the said maistre Geofroy Tory, and having regard
to the toil, labour, outlays and expense which it hath behooved him
to undergo and sustain, as well in the composition of the said books, as for
the engraving of the said drawings, vignettes, friezes, borders, crowns
and scrolls to accompany the said Hours, as hereinbefore mentioned, in
divers forms and sizes,&mdash;have granted to him the privilege of printing
the said books, enjoining you not to allow any other printers or booksellers
within our realm, domains and seignories to print the said books
and Hours, on pain of one hundred silver marcs to be paid to us, and of
confiscation of said books. Given at Chenonceau the fifth day of September,
in the year of grace one thousand five hundred twenty-six, and of
our reign the twelfth.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In this new book of Hours there are thirty-two different borders,
which reappear on every second leaf&mdash;one hundred and twenty-eight
in all. The text is embellished by sixteen large subjects, naturally smaller,
however, than those in the quarto. In the copy at the Arsenal, the only
one that I have seen, these subjects are coloured. I did not discover Tory's
mark anywhere; but his mottoes do appear,&mdash;'menti bonæ devs occvrrit';<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
'sic vt, vel vt'; 'non plvs';&mdash;which proves that these plates were engraved
for him, if not by him.</p>

<p>A list of the drawings follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>1 and 2. The Angelic Salutation; two plates on adjoining pages, as
in the quarto of 1524-1525.</p>

<p>3. The Visitation of the Virgin.</p>

<p>4. The Birth of Jesus.</p>

<p>5. The Annunciation to the Shepherds.</p>

<p>6. The Adoration of the Magi.</p>

<p>7. The Circumcision.</p>

<p>8. The Flight into Egypt.</p>

<p>9. The Coronation of the Virgin.</p>

<p>10. St. Joachim and St. Anne Embracing (this is not included in the
edition of 1524-1525).</p>

<p>11. The Crucifixion.</p>

<p>12. The Descent of the Holy Spirit on the Apostles.</p>

<p>13. The Penance of David.</p>

<p>14. The Triumph of Death.</p>

<p>15. The Holy Trinity.</p>

<p>16. The Virgin and the Child Jesus.</p>

<p>(The last two are not included in the edition of 1524-1525.)</p></blockquote>

<p>The signatures run from A to Z; that is to say, there are twenty-three
octavo sheets.</p>

<p>The copy of the octavo Hours of 1527 at the Arsenal is a lovely volume
printed on vellum, with a number of manuscript prayers in French
added at the end. The calligraphic execution of these prayers, which are
surrounded by borders in imitation of those in the book, is wonderfully
fine. The colouring of the plates and the illuminating of the initial letters
and of those at the ends of paragraphs make the volume of great value.
It is still in its original binding (once very sumptuous, but now sadly out
of repair), on the covers of which one can distinguish interlaced C's,
barred S's, and star-shaped figures formed of two triangles turned end for
end. Can it have belonged to Catherine de Médicis, who became the consort
of Henri II in 1533? Unluckily it lacks two essential leaves, the first
and the last.</p>


<p class="p6">3</p>

<p>I<span class="smcapa">N</span> the same year, Tory had printed by Simon Dubois ('Silvius') a quarto
edition of this same book of Hours, 'suivant l'usage de Paris.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p>It is dated October 22, 1527. It contains the new license, and comprises
thirty-six quarto sheets, folded two by two according to custom, and forming
eighteen octavo signatures, A to S. The book is printed throughout
in the gothic type of that time, with the borders 'à la moderne' mentioned
in the license of 1524, consisting of arabesques of flowers, insects,
animals, etc. There are twenty-six complete borders, which recur in
regular order. We find again here, as in the first quarto, thirteen large
subjects interspersed through the text. But a noteworthy fact is, that although
these subjects, with two exceptions,<a name="FNanchor_247_247" id="FNanchor_247_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a> are the same as those in the
first quarto, they are of entirely different designs, appropriate to the
'modern' borders and type. It would be difficult to carry further the love
of artistic harmony. Neither the borders nor the illustrations bear Tory's
mark, and I doubt whether they are his. Perhaps the design was Perreal's
and the engraving by one of the artists employed by Tory, who must
then have had an organized workshop, if we may judge from the number
of works which he produced about that time.</p>

<p>Dibdin speaks enthusiastically of this edition of the Hours, in his
'Bibliographical Decameron'; he even reproduces four of the large cuts
by which it is illustrated.<a name="FNanchor_248_248" id="FNanchor_248_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a> He says that it is the 'most beautiful work'
of that sort that he has ever seen, and expresses great surprise that the
arabesques have been cast aside. I confess that I do not share his feeling.
The book seems to me badly done, both from the artistic and from the
typographical standpoint: the borders do not harmonize, they are out
of proportion, and the engraving does not impress me as beyond reproach.
But Dibdin's opinion is, as everybody knows, very unreliable; his carelessness
is proverbial. Indeed, he gives us a striking instance of it in this very
passage: for he tells us that this book was published by Tory of 'Bruges,'
and that it has on the title, the Pot Cassé of Simon du Bois<a name="FNanchor_249_249" id="FNanchor_249_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a>; two errors
in one line!</p>

<p>Among the small cuts at the foot of the pages, we observe the shield
of France; the crowned F; the crowned salamander; the crest of the king's
mother, 'party' of France and of Savoy, with her widow's girdle; her initial
(L), crowned; the shield 'party' of Navarre and of France, with the
letters H and M intertwined (the initials of Henri d'Albert, King of
Navarre, and Marguerite, sister of François I, whose marriage had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>

simplest form, etc.</p>

<p>The exact title of this book is as follows: 'Hore in laudem beatissime
Virginis M<span class="smcapa">ARIE</span>: secundum consuetudinem E<span class="smcapa">CCLESIE</span> P<span class="smcapa">ARISIENSIS</span>.'

in small capitals are printed in red. On the verso of the title-page is the
license, dated September 5, 1526. At the end of the book is the following:
'Ces presentes Heures a lusage de Paris, privilegiees pour dix ans
commenceans a la presente date de leur impression, furent achevees dimprimer
le vingt deuxiesme iour Doctobre, Mil cinq cens vingt sept, par

the first page.)</p>

<p>It will be noticed that, although Tory felt bound to give the title of
the book in Latin, he could not forbear to print his address in French.</p>

<p>This is the order of the plates, all of which measure nine centimetres
by six:&mdash;</p>

<p>Here is a description of this little gem, taken from the only copy that

<p>The volume contains twenty-one small cuts, unsigned, but all engraved

<blockquote>

<p>1. Jesus on the Cross; a very small cut with five sections, like the
Crucifixion of the quarto of 1524-1525; that is to say, there are bees at
work, birds building their nests, a peasant ploughing, and another shearing
sheep.</p>

<p>2 and 3. The Angelic Salutation; two cuts facing each other, as in
the Hours of 1524-1525.</p>

we read:&mdash;</p>

<p>On the verso of the title the list of Easter-Days, from 1531 to 1560;
then the Calendar, the type in which this is set being so large that it was
necessary to omit the arabesques with figures at the foot of the border
and substitute simple arabesques like those at the top.</p>

<p>On the recto of the last leaf is the abstract of the licenses, papal and
royal, and on the verso this colophon, set in the border of the last page of
'Champ fleury': 'Parrhisiis, ex officina Gotofredi Torini Biturigici, regii
impressoris, ad insigne Vasis effracti, anno salu[tis] <span class="smcapa">M. D. XXXI</span>, die <span class="smcapa">XX</span> mensis

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">'Effracti, lector, subeas insignia vasis,</div>
  <div class="i1">Egregios flores ut tibi habere queis.'</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The volume consists of twenty signatures (A to V) of two sheets
each, set in the roman type used in 'Champ fleury'; borders of the Hours<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
of 1524-1525; also the thirteen drawings of that edition, but with special
borders in the form of porticoes, which appear in other minor works
of Tory published in 1531, of which we shall speak in the following section.
It is a fact worthy of remark that we no longer find the name Geofroy
Tory on his borders, and that even his mark has disappeared from several
of the cuts, particularly the first cut of the Angelic Salutation,<a name="FNanchor_255_255" id="FNanchor_255_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a> the Adoration
of the Shepherds, the Adoration of the Magi, the Flight into
Egypt, the Coronation of the Virgin, the Penance of David, and the
Triumph of Death. This circumstance leads me to believe that Tory had
lent these plates to other publishers, as he had lent his borders to Simon de
Colines, and that they removed the marks in order to appropriate more
completely the publications in which the plates were used. This was what
Simon de Colines did, as we have already seen (page 120).</p>

<p>A no less interesting fact is that, in the borders, the crowned C's are
retained, which refer to Claude de France, the first wife of François I,
who died in 1524 and was succeeded in 1530 by Eleonora of Austria.</p>

<p>We find also in this edition four unsigned cuts which do not appear
in the quarto of 1524-1525:&mdash;</p>

<p>Fol. H 8. The Angelic Salutation; a special design, quarto size.</p>

<p>Fol. L 6. The Angelic Salutation; quite small, occupying only the
upper part of a page.</p>

<p>Fol. R 7. The Trinity; small, with a special border.</p>

<p>Fol. V 3. The Virgin; small, with a special border.</p>

<p>The last two are taken from the 16mo Hours of 1529. The floriated
letters are the same as in 'Champ fleury.'</p>

<p>Papillon, who speaks of this book,<a name="FNanchor_256_256" id="FNanchor_256_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a> without giving the title, and attributes
it to Woeiriot, who was not born in 1531, expresses himself
thus concerning it: 'I have seen an old book in which there are some of
his engravings; it is an octavo, each page of which is surrounded by a decorative
border, in compartments, of a beautiful gothic type. They are engraved
very correctly, even though it is line engraving, which is so fine,
so even and so accurate, that I am at a loss to understand how it could
have been done. There are in this book fifteen or sixteen large cuts, also
engraved in line; the drawing of the figures is passable. The little Lorraine
cross, which Woeiriot used as a mark, may be seen in several places
in the borders of this book.'</p>

<p>M. de Rothschild's copy of this edition has one interesting peculiarity:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
it is enriched by a large plate, unsigned, printed on an oblong
half-sheet, representing the Triumph of the Virgin Mary, which seems
to be an imitation of the Triumph of Apollo in 'Champ fleury.' The
Virgin appears in a chariot drawn by unicorns; behind the chariot are
the Captive Women; around the chariot, Prudence, Temperance, Justice
and Strength; in front of the unicorns, Hope, Faith, Charity; and
farther in front the Nine Muses, the Seven Liberal Arts, the handmaidens
of the Virgin. In the background, we see the Virginal Palace, the Palace
of Jesse, and the Temple of Honour. Beneath the picture is an explanation
in French verse, which begins thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">'Les antiques Cesars triompherent par gloire,</div>
  <div class="i0">Mais par humilite (ainsi le faut il croire)</div>
  <div class="i0">La noble Vierge va triomphante en bon heur</div>
  <div class="i0">Du palais virginal jusquau temple dhonneur.'</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>I have seen this engraving nowhere else except in a copy of the edition
of the Hours published in 1542 by Olivier Mallard, of which I shall
speak in the third part; but I have no doubt that it was included originally
in all copies of the edition of 1531, perhaps also in that of 1524-1525.
Its chances of preservation were injured by its being bound in the
form of a map. At all events this unsigned plate is in Tory's manner,
and it can hardly be denied that it belongs to him.</p>


<p class="p6">6</p>

<p>At a time which I am unable to fix with precision, but not earlier than
the month of September, 1531, Tory printed another book, in octavo, with
borders made up of plants, animals, insects, birds, etc., like those in the
quarto Hours of 1527, but, naturally, on a smaller scale. I have never
seen this book, but its existence is established to my satisfaction by the
publication of a book of Hours, at a later date, by Olivier Mallard, with
the same borders and vignettes. I can give with certainty neither the title
nor the date of printing of Tory's book; but the date of the engravings
is readily determined approximately, thanks to certain ornaments of
Mallard's book. For instance, we find in it, as in the Hours of 1527, the
crowned F and the salamander of François I, the crowned L and the
biparted shield (France and Savoy) of his mother, who died in 1531,
and a blank shield which suggests the widowhood of François, and consequently
proves that these cuts were designed before July, 1530. As for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
my ascription of these cuts to Tory, it is due to the style of the borders,
which are copied from the Hours of 1527. Moreover, he has added a
special symbol, namely, the coat-of-arms of Bourges (three sheep, placed
two and one, and wearing collars), which appears now and again at the
foot of the page, beside the symbols of François I and his mother. As I
have said, I do not know the title of the book in which Tory first used
these cuts; it seems to me, however, that we may fairly conclude from
the use Olivier Mallard made of them that it was a book of Hours; Tory
probably decided to publish an octavo edition of his Hours 'à la moderne'
of 1527, as he had published in 1527 an octavo edition of his Hours
'à l'antique' of 1524-1525. Indeed, it may be that the book in question is
the one thus described by M. Brunet: 'Horæ in laudem beatissimæ Virginis
Mariæ ad usum Rothomagensem.&mdash;Parisiis, ad insigne Vasis effracti.
1536.' Small octavo, roman type, line engravings.</p>

<p>It will be seen that the book is said to be printed at the sign of the
Pot Cassé, without mention of the printer's name. This may mean that
it was printed by Tory's widow, who published Macault's work in the
same way in 1535.</p>

<p>We shall speak elsewhere of Mallard's book, but this is the place
to mention the engravings it contains, which doubtless appeared also in
Tory's book. In Mallard's publication of 1541 there are sixteen different
borders, the same one being always placed on the recto and verso of each
leaf, and nineteen of the plates of the 16mo edition of 1529. The two
lacking are number 1 and number 21. [The engravings of The Visitation
are reproduced below.]</p>

Quarto, of six signatures. [Paris, Geofroy Tory, 1531.]</p></blockquote>

<p>This title is set within the charming title-page border of the Colines
copies of the Hours of 1524-1525. On the verso of the title-page: 'Il est
permis,' etc., as in the preceding volume. On the second leaf the text begins
with a beautiful decorated letter (A) after the style of the L of the
volume last described. This page also is set in a portico-shaped border,
with arabesques; but the latter are different from those in the 'Sacre.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<p>We find, too, three other and different borders in the balance of the
work, which gives us in all six pages with borders in addition to that
of the title-page and that of the last page, which is identical with that of
the last page of 'Champ fleury'; some floriated letters also have been
borrowed from this last-named work. Though none of these are signed,
they are surely Tory's, so far as the designs are concerned, at least.</p>

<p>The text of this book, as of the preceding, is by Guillaume Bochetel,
who signed it. Following his text, Tory inserted a charming cut, representing
the gift presented by the city of Paris to the Queen&mdash;a magnificent
candelabrum. At the top are the words: 'Deseing du present faict a la
Royne en deux chandeliers.'<a name="FNanchor_260_260" id="FNanchor_260_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a> The license granted to Tory for printing
this book is identical with that of the preceding, except that it is dated
at Anet, April 26, 1531. We learn from the last page that the printing was
finished on Tuesday, May 9, 1531.</p>

<p>Geofroy Tory was not simply the printer of this little volume; he
was also the publisher, and he added to the text three poems in Latin, of
his own composition. Here they are:&mdash;</p>


<p class="center"><em>Geofroy Tory of Bourges to Queen Leonora.</em><a name="FNanchor_261_261" id="FNanchor_261_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a></p>

<p>We are about to celebrate this triumph of yours, Leonora, which
your Parisians have conferred upon you. You are a queen so loving-kind
to us that we all can say that you are a real goddess. We can certainly
say that you are a benign goddess, since you at last bless us with grateful
peace. With peace you bless all who inhabit the French kingdom,
so kind have been the fates in establishing you in power. As one upright,
aye, holy, gentle, and a true bestower of blessings, you have
brought our lilies back to their country. By your leave, I will speak in
few words, and I will proclaim the truth: in you resides full national salvation
for us all.</p>


<p class="center"><em>The same to the same.</em></p>

<p>May the gods long continue your happy lot, Leonora. You are our
Joy, our Peace, and our grateful Repose.</p>


<p class="center"><em>The same Tory to the French People.</em></p>

<p>Exult and be glad, people of France; you see what happiness Leonora
now brings to you. She, sent, be sure, by the manifest will of God, enables
you at last to enjoy the blessings of peace. Strew roses, laurel, violets,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
nard, and saffron, and merrily revel to your hearts' content. But be
careful too that you, best of people, be not backward in rendering pious
prayers to God. If you never cease to sing God's praises and to frequent
his temples, believe me, you will long enjoy the blessings of peace. You
will behold the golden ages beneath the smiling heaven, and on earth you
will reap in prosperity golden harvests. Add to this that you will in similar
manner become a race all golden too. Continue, therefore, your holy services
to the most high God.</p>

<p>France, why do you in deepest sorrow mourn for me? Do you not
know that the whole human race is destined to die? Revive, and consider
how I by my foresight preserved you from the bitter and ruthless enemy.
I leave to you a son, king by divine will, who under my guidance cherishes
you in glorious peace. Joyfully he beholds in your arms his pledges,
who will bring the whole world under your sway. You have a queen
who is the foster-daughter of virtue and peace, and who blesses your lot
with good fortune. You have also another queen, who is the sister and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
good counselor of your consecrated king. With such guides as these, dear
France, you should not complain. You are fortunate in having such leaders.
Moreover, when I die, I will not desert you, for you have my immortal
name. Devotedly I will ever pray for you before the mighty
Thunderer, asking that you may reign victoriously and nobly. Strew
laurel for me, violets, nard, and saffron; strew also flowers, lilies, garlands,
and roses. Add to these, moreover, hymns with most exalted praises,
rites, melodies, incense, myrrh, and prayers. Hesitate not to erect altars to
me. For, as a benign goddess, I now proceed to fly to Heaven. Farewell.</p>

<p>The first two of these three opuscula exhibit three different kinds of
type: that of 'Champ fleury' and two others. In the third we find a fourth

<p>I have seen only the last signature of this collection. It has a special
title-page, embellished by the border of the Colines copies of the Hours
of 1524-1525; but the signature letter (D) and the first word of the title
demonstrate the existence of at least three others. It seems that Geofroy
Tory treated the legislative documents of François I in the sixteenth century
as the Imperial printing-office treats the 'Bulletin des Lois' to-day:
that is to say, each fold has a title, although it forms a part of the same
publication with that which precedes and that which follows.</p>

<p>The title-page of this book is embellished by a portico-shaped border,
which is found in the first three opuscula described in this section. On
the verso of the title, in the vellum copy at the Bibliothèque Nationale,
is the final border of 'Champ fleury,' in which are depicted the arms of
England, with the device, DIEV EST [<em>sic</em>] MON DROICT.</p>

<p>The author's exordium begins with a large letter S, decorated with
an escutcheon bearing two fasces accompanied by nine besants, three
by three, with this device in Greek: <span class="smcapa">MHKETI</span> ('not at all'); these are
Macault's arms, doubtless. This letter appears again on folio 148. Facing
the first page of text is a magnificent engraving representing François I
surrounded by his court, listening to Macault as he reads his book to
the king. The author is represented in a clerical costume, with a calotte
on his head. Beside him are the three sons of François I: François, who
died a few years later, Henri, who became Henri II, and Charles, Duc d'Orléans.
This engraving is a faithful copy of the painting on Macault's original
manuscript, which was still in France in 1811, but has since crossed
over to England. It is described in Part 3, section 1 (pages <a href="#Page_166">166</a>-<a href="#Page_168">168</a>).</p>

<p>The printed book forms a quarto volume of 8 unnumbered preliminary
leaves, 152 numbered leaves (signatures A to Q), and 8 leaves of
index: 168 leaves in all. On the last page is the final border of 'Champ

Nationale. The volume consists, first, of four preliminary leaves
(half a fold), comprising: (1) the title which I have just transcribed;
(2) on the verso, some laudatory verses, among which figures this distich
of Tory, who was not only Marot's printer, but his friend:&mdash;</p>

<p>(3) Clément's letter 'to a large number of brethren,' dated August 12,
1532, that is to say, on the same day that Tory finished printing the
book, and not August 12, 1530, as was erroneously printed in some subsequent
editions, which has given rise to a theory of an earlier issue<a name="FNanchor_273_273" id="FNanchor_273_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a>;
(4) the table of contents; (5) a leaf entirely blank. Then comes the
text of the 'Adolescence Clementine,' extending from folio 1 to folio
104, on which is the word 'finis'; and after that the 'Chant royal,' etc.,
from 105 to 115. The book ends with a list of errata on an unnumbered
folio (116). The table of contents, on one of the preliminary leaves, informs
us that one ode had previously been published separately, but no
copy of it is known.</p>


<p class="p6">5</p>

<p><em>The Same.</em></p>

<p>A second edition of this book was published by the same bookseller,
and the printing finished by Tory on November 13, 1532. It differs from
the first in this respect, that the text and preliminary leaves are joined,
or, to speak more accurately, the first two of those leaves; for the table
of contents is relegated to the end of the volume, in place of the errata,
which no longer appear. The volume consists of a hundred and nineteen
leaves, the last unnumbered. The word 'finis' still appears on folio
104, after the 'Adolescence Clementine'; then comes the 'Chant royal,'
etc.; and lastly two leaves entitled: 'Autres Œuvres faictes en sa dicte
maladie,' indicated by this phrase on the title-page: 'Plus amples que
les premiers imprimez de ceste, ny autre impression.' (Bibliothèque
Mazarine.)</p>


<p class="p6">6</p>

<p><em>The Same.</em></p>

<p>A third edition was printed by Tory on February 12, 1532 (1533,
new style), like the preceding in every respect, but having only 118 leaves.</p>

<p class="p6">7</p>

<p><em>The Same.</em></p>

<p>A fourth edition appeared June 7, 1533, identical with the preceding,
except that the words on the title-page, 'plus amples,' etc. are replaced
by these: 'Avec certains accens notez, cest assavoir sur le é masculin

<p>This fourth edition of the 'Adolescence Clementine' was the last work

<p> <span class="drop-cap">A</span><span class="smcapa">S</span> I have hitherto called attention to the books that we owe to Tory
whether as publisher, as author, or as printer and bookseller, so it will
be well to notice those which he enriched with his paintings and engravings
during twenty years of his life. This is a new aspect of his whole
career which it is our present purpose to bring into view; for, while Tory
was for some time teacher, bookseller, printer, he was always a draughtsman
and engraver, from the day that he was a man grown.</p>

<p>But, first of all, there is a preliminary question to be decided: Was
Tory really a painter and engraver? In the first part of this book I said
that he was, but I did not furnish proofs of the fact, and none of the historians
of painting or of engraving have mentioned him in that connection.
It is advisable therefore, first of all, to demonstrate the accuracy of
my assertion. In order to solve this complicated question more easily, let
us divide it.</p>

<p>Was Tory a painter?</p>

<p>That Tory was a painter-draughtsman, there can be no doubt, for he
himself makes the assertion in express terms on each page of 'Champ
fleury.' For instance, we read on folio 3 verso of that work, apropos of
the Gallic Hercules:&mdash;</p>

<p>'I saw this same fable in rich painting within the city of Rome near
the Sanguine tower, not far from the Church of Saint Louis, ... and
the better to keep the thing in my eye, I made this drawing....'</p>

<p>In the collection of verses written by him on the occasion of the
death of his daughter Agnes, Tory makes her speak thus from the urn
wherein she is supposed to repose:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">MONITOR.</p>

<p>Who made for you this urn, set with brilliant gems?</p>

<p class="center">AGNES.</p>

<p>Who? My father; famed in this art.</p>

<p class="center">MONITOR.</p>

<p>Certes, your father is an excellent potter.</p>

<p class="center">AGNES.</p>

<p>He practises industriously every day the liberal arts.</p></blockquote>

<p>Thus Geofroy Tory himself informs us in 1523 that he industriously
practised the arts. Now, if this were true, he could not have been ignorant
of drawing, which is the first of all the arts. Moreover, it is plain
that in those days an engraver (and we shall prove in a moment that
Tory was one) could not fail to be a draughtsman. The artist was at that
time an all-round workman, embracing all the special branches of his
profession: painting, drawing, engraving, he took a hand at them all.
Not until it became vulgarized, until it became a trade, was art subdivided&mdash;and
greatly to its prejudice. In truth, one cannot but realize all
that there is to be desired in the work of those mercenaries of the engraver's
art, who, having no knowledge of the first elements of drawing,
are bidden to reproduce, with the aid of the graving tool, lines which
they do not understand.</p>

<p>We can therefore assert that, as a general rule, the engravings found
in Tory's books were drawn by him.</p>

<p>But this is not all: I believe that we should also attribute to him the
admirable miniatures<a name="FNanchor_275_275" id="FNanchor_275_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_275_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a> that have come down to us of the painter known by
the name of 'Godefroy.' If, indeed, we compare the engravings in Tory's
books with the designs of that painter, we readily recognize a similarity
of execution which seems to establish the identity of the two men. This
Godefroy, who signs his works sometimes with the full name, sometimes
with a simple G, but always in roman letters,&mdash;a noteworthy thing at a
time when the gothic was in its most flourishing state,&mdash;was no other
than Tory, whose baptismal name, as we have seen, was in Latin Godofredus.
We know how little was thought of family names in the old
days. As late as the sixteenth century it was no uncommon thing to see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
persons designated by their baptismal names alone, or, at most, with the
name of their native place added. We have seen<a name="FNanchor_276_276" id="FNanchor_276_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_276_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a> that the famous painter
Jean Perreal, Tory's master and friend, was little known except by the
name of Jean de Paris. Tory himself is called Godefroy the Berrichon
(Godofredus Biturix) in some verses which his friend Gérard de Vercel
composed in his praise in 1512.<a name="FNanchor_277_277" id="FNanchor_277_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_277_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a> Even at the close of the sixteenth century
our two leading bibliographers, Antoine du Verdier and La Croix
du Maine, who also bore geographical names, deemed it proper to adopt
no other order than that of baptismal names in arranging alphabetically
the authors who are mentioned in their books entitled 'Bibliothèque
Françoise.' There is nothing extraordinary therefore in Tory's signing
his first works with a baptismal name alone. It is true that that name is
slightly different, orthographically speaking, from the one that he used
later; but it is well to remember the change that took place about that
time in our author's customs. Doubtless he signed 'Godefroy' before he
had entirely shaken off the yoke of the classical languages,<a name="FNanchor_278_278" id="FNanchor_278_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_278_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a> and had
adopted the more French form 'Geofroy,' which was about the year
1523.</p>

<p>The dates inscribed upon some of Godefroy's paintings, 1519 and 1520,
coincide perfectly with the known facts of Tory's life: that was the
period when, after his second return from Italy, he was fain to utilize
his talents for his livelihood. I may add that we have several engravings
of that same period signed with a G alone, or with a G within which appears
a small <span class="smcapa">F</span>; others signed with a G surmounted by the double cross,
with a small <span class="smcapa">S</span> within; and others signed G. T., which serve to mark the
transition between Tory's use of the simple G and the inscription in full
of his two names, Geofroy Tory. These two names appear together in
one of the borders of his Hours of 1524-1525 [the border which is to
be found on p. 105].</p>

<p>Whatever the fact may be, we propose to give here, by way of memorandum,
at least a brief list of the works of the painter Godefroy, referring
the reader for fuller information to the interesting article which M.
Léon de Laborde has published upon this subject in the 'Renaissance des
Arts,' vol. i. pp. 891-913, and, later, in the 'Revue Universelle des Arts,' no.
1 (1855), which article we reproduce below with the author's consent.</p>

<p>The only manuscripts known to contain drawings of this artist are
'Les Commentaires de César,' in three small quarto volumes; and 'Les<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
Triomphes de Petrarque,' in one small octavo volume&mdash;all written in
French and bound in vellum.</p>

<p>The first-named work is not, as one might suppose from its title, a
translation of the famous work of the conqueror of Gaul, but a commentary
thereon in the form of a dialogue between Cæsar and François
I, to whom the book is dedicated. The first volume is now in the British
Museum at London, the second in the Bibliothèque Nationale at Paris,
and the third in the collection of M. le Duc d'Aumale. All the miniatures
in the first volume, and there is a great number of them, are signed
with a G; some bear the date 1519. The same is true of the second volume.
One of the miniatures in the third volume is signed in full, 'Godefroy'
(folio 52); several others, signed G only, are dated 1520.</p>

<p>As for the 'Triumphs' of Petrarch, which is in the Bibliothèque de
l'Arsenal, the miniatures bear no dates, but they are all signed with a G,
and one has in addition the full name, 'Godefroy.' In the two works the
drawings have the same general appearance; they are distinguished from
those of the professional miniaturists by a very marked sobriety of colouring.
They are noticeable, moreover, by reason of a delicacy of execution
and, at the same time, a sharpness of outline which can have come
from no other hand than that of an engraver; now the engraver can
have been no other than Tory, whose shields and even his antique arabesques
we find in these designs.</p>

<p>In addition to these two works, of which the name and the <em>style</em> of
the artist seem to me to permit their being attributed to Tory, I will
mention here several others, of a somewhat later date, which likewise
various circumstances make it possible to attribute to him.</p>

<p>The first is a translation of the first three books of Diodorus Siculus,
by Antoine Macault. This superb manuscript, which was in the library
of M. Firmin Didot <em>père</em> in 1810, is to-day buried in one of the private
libraries of England. A description will be found on pp. 166-168. It is true
that there is nothing about it to suggest Tory, but the style of the painting
and of the engraving (the book was printed by Tory's widow in
1535) leaves no doubt as to his authorship. The second is a collection of
portraits of the kings of France, by Jean du Tillet, the manuscript of
which, presented by the author to Charles IX, is still preserved in the
Bibliothèque du Roi. See the description of this priceless manuscript, and
of several others preserved in the same collection.<a name="FNanchor_279_279" id="FNanchor_279_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_279_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a></p>

<p>We come now to the second question:&mdash;Was Tory an engraver?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>Neither Zani nor Papillon mentions him as such; nevertheless, there
is one presumption in his favour. La Croix du Maine, who was almost his
contemporary, tells us<a name="FNanchor_280_280" id="FNanchor_280_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_280_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a>, without going into details, it is true, that Tory
was known by the name 'maître au Pot Cassé'; others have said that he
perfected Josse Bade's letters.<a name="FNanchor_281_281" id="FNanchor_281_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_281_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a> M. Renouvier has recently written<a name="FNanchor_282_282" id="FNanchor_282_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_282_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a> that
Tory possessed the rare faculty of using the 'eschoppe' [graver] as well as
the pen. 'Le Champ fleury,' he says, 'is a treatise on æsthetics such as none
but an engraver of types could conceive.' What M. Renouvier conjectured,
I assert, with no fear of being contradicted by the facts. To be sure, Tory
did not anywhere state categorically that he was an engraver; but he gave
it to be understood indirectly. For example, he tells us that, among the
fancies that came to his mind on the 6th of January, 1523, and resulted in
the composition of 'Champ fleury,' he remembered 'a letter of ancient
form,' which he had 'not long since made for the house of my lord the
treasurer of the wars, maistre Jehan Groslier, counsellor and secretary to
the king our sire.'<a name="FNanchor_283_283" id="FNanchor_283_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_283_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a> What was this ancient letter made for the famous bibliophile
Grolier, if not the basis of the beautiful roman characters which
were used in that scholar's establishment to decorate his books, and to
stamp upon them, in gold, this excellent device, among others, 'Ioannis
Grolierii et Amicorum?'<a name="FNanchor_284_284" id="FNanchor_284_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_284_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a></p>

<p>Again, all the authorities agree that Claude Garamond was a pupil of
Tory. Now, what could he have learned from his master, if not the art of
engraving types,&mdash;he who did nothing else in his whole life?</p>

<p>Furthermore, it is impossible to doubt that Tory engraved types when
one runs through his 'Champ fleury.' Note especially what he says on folio
34 recto, where, having given a drawing of a capital A reversed, he explains
it in the technical terms of the engraver.</p>

<p>'This,' he says, 'is done to help and give hints to goldsmiths and engravers,
who, with their burin, graver, or other tool, engrave and cut an
ancient letter reversed [à l'envers], or, as we say, to the left, so that it
may appear to the right when it is printed and placed in its proper aspect.
I have purposely made it white, and its background black, the
opposite of the one that is drawn to the right, so that no one may be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
misled. For, as I have said, I have seen and do see many persons who are
misled. Before the letter to be printed is finished, it is made twice reversed
and twice to the right. In the first of the reversed there are the
punches<a name="FNanchor_285_285" id="FNanchor_285_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_285_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a> of steel, in which the letter is wholly left-handed. The matrices
have the letter to the right. The letter then cast is, as I have said
of the punches, left-handed. Then finally on the printed paper the whole
appears to the right, and in its proper aspect to be read currently. I had
forgotten to say that the broad leg of the A is one tenth of its square in
width, and the other leg one third as wide. The transverse limb should be
three fourths as wide as the broad leg, as you may see by the drawings
herewith made and duly proportioned.'</p>

<p>After this, and knowing as we do the relations between Geofroy Tory
and the Estienne family, it will not be deemed extraordinary that I attribute
to our artist the italic letters of Simon de Colines, engraved about
1525, and the roman and italic letters of Robert Estienne, engraved a little
later.</p>

<p>But Tory not only engraved letters, that is to say, punches on steel,
as some authors have stated: he signalized himself above all by his engravings
on wood, and he illustrated almost all the books of his time,
which fact is almost wholly unknown. I shall be asked, doubtless, upon
what evidence my opinion is based. It is this: In the license to print the
book of Hours, granted to Tory by François I on September 23, 1524,
we read:<a name="FNanchor_286_286" id="FNanchor_286_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_286_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a> 'Our dear and well-beloved maistre Geofroy Tory ... hath
now caused it to be made known and shown unto us that <em>he hath of late
made</em> and caused to be made certain pictures and vignettes "à l'antique,"
and likewise certain others, "à la moderne," to the end that the same may
be printed and made use of in divers books of Hours, whereupon he
hath employed himself a very long time, and hath made divers great
expenditures and outlays.' Evidently the words 'he hath made' do not
here apply to the drawing, but to the engraving of these pictures and
vignettes, which he had previously drawn. Moreover, Tory himself betrayed
his profession of engraver on wood in a charming vignette which
he used as an initial in 'Champ fleury,' and which is reproduced on page 1.
For we see therein, besides a compass, a square, etc., a pen and several
varieties of knives used in wood-engraving; all of which justifies the remark
of M. Renouvier: 'Tory possessed the rare faculty of using the graver
as well as the pen.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<p>But, I shall be told, it avails nothing to prove vaguely that Tory dabbled
in wood-engraving, if we can point to no works of his in that branch
of the art,&mdash;for no one has done so hitherto. I propose to try to gratify
the reader's desire, by proving that there is a way to recognize the engravings
executed by Tory.</p>

<p>Many persons have already observed that the principal engravings in
Tory's books, those which are most individual, as, for example, the Gallic
Hercules (reproduced on page <a href="#Page_141">141</a>), and that of the Pot Cassé which
accompanies the description of that emblem in 'Champ fleury' (reproduced
on page <a href="#Page_21">21</a>) bear a mark; but this mark they dare not attribute
to him, because it is constantly found upon engravings, alone or accompanied
by initials, for more than a century. M. Robert-Dumesnil, in his
interesting work entitled 'Le Peintre-Graveur français,' published in the
course of his article on Woeiriot,<a name="FNanchor_287_287" id="FNanchor_287_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_287_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a> who himself used this same mark, a
catalogue of engravings signed with the double cross,&mdash;which he calls
the cross of Lorraine or of Jerusalem,&mdash;extending from 1522 to 1632. He
concludes that this mark was 'frequently employed in France, as a fictitious
signature, on engravings on wood, by artists whose names will probably
remain forever buried in oblivion.'</p>

<p>To banish this phantom, which caused M. Renouvier himself to
pause on the pathway of truth,<a name="FNanchor_288_288" id="FNanchor_288_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_288_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a> it is sufficient to come to close quarters
with it. This is what I propose to do; but first I must thank M. Robert-Dumesnil
for having satisfactorily cleared up one important point. Until
his book appeared, almost all the engravings marked with the double
cross had been attributed to Woeiriot; or, rather, the engravings of the
latter had added to the perplexity of classifiers. By identifying Woeiriot's
work, M. Robert-Dumesnil has simplified the problem considerably. Only
a small number of pieces remain to be ascribed to their authors, and as to
these M. Robert-Dumesnil expresses himself thus: 'None of the works
executed prior to Woeiriot's birth and the beginning of his career as an artist
can be by him; of the others we hasten to say that not one seems to us
to have been designed or executed by him.'</p>

<p>Nothing could be clearer. Let us add, to close the discussion, that
Woeiriot did not begin to engrave until long after Tory had ceased, as
he was barely two years old when Tory died; and, furthermore, that his
cross is almost always accompanied by his initials; sometimes, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
he uses the cross alone, but in that case the date prevents confusion.
Take, for example, the 'Emblesmes et devises chrestiennes composées par
damoiselle Georgette de Montenay,' the first edition of which was in 1571.
It is impossible to attribute these engravings to Tory, who died nearly forty
years earlier.</p>

<p>The other artists who used the cross may be divided into three classes,
according to M. Robert-Dumesnil's book. First, we find the cross alone,
from 1522 to 1561; secondly, after a long interval, in 1599, the cross appears
accompanied by the initials I, L, B; and, lastly, a little later, two engravers
on copper, named Jean Barra and Claude Rivard, signed their works with
the cross. I do not include here the double cross discovered by M. Robert-Dumesnil
on the printer's mark of a book dated 1632, because it is the mark
of Gilles Corrozet, engraved a century earlier, as we shall see further on.</p>

<p>To sum up, then, there are no anonymous works bearing the cross
except those produced between 1522 and 1561. The only question is
whether the engravings executed between those dates, which bear the
cross without initials, belong to one or to several artists.</p>

<p>I will, first of all, call attention to the fact that this interval embraces
only forty years, and that there is no reason to attribute to several contemporaneous
and anonymous artists a very peculiar mark which a single
artist might have used during an even longer time. But this is not all:
this interval can be reduced by several years; for the examples alleged
to be subsequent to 1557, mentioned by M. Robert-Dumesnil, bear no date;
they appear, it is true, in books printed after that year, but they were engraved
earlier, as I shall prove in due time. Blocks are not ephemeral objects;
like type, they can be used indefinitely, and their use at a certain
date does not prove that they had been made within a short time. We
have just cited one&mdash;Gilles Corrozet's mark&mdash;which, simply by lack of
use, it was possible to reproduce in books for more than a century.</p>

<p>What surprises me is not that M. Robert-Dumesnil has seen engravings
with the cross printed in 1561, but that he has found none of a later
date, which would have allowed him to fill up the gap that he has left
between the anonymous artist of the cross alone and him who accompanied
it with the letters I, L, B; he might have discovered the beautiful
illustration of the Missal of 1539, which is described hereafter, in
books of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Indeed, we find wood
engravings of the sixteenth century, bearing the double cross, in a book
published at Troyes in 1850!</p>

<p>On the other hand, I am surprised that M. Robert-Dumesnil found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
no engravings with the cross, accompanied by initials, of a date much
earlier than 1599, for I myself have seen some that were contemporaneous
with Tory. In fact, the Bibliothèque Nationale possesses a book of
Hours according to the use of Paris, printed in that city in 1548, by Jean
de Brye's widow, in which all the engravings are marked with the cross
and the initials L, R. It is an octavo volume, printed in gothic type, and
in red and black. An interesting fact to be noted here is that these engravings
are improved copies of other unsigned engravings belonging
to the printer Thielman Kerver,<a name="FNanchor_289_289" id="FNanchor_289_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_289_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a> and printed in a large number of books
issued by him or his widow, Iolande Bonhomme, at least as early as 1522,<a name="FNanchor_290_290" id="FNanchor_290_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_290_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a>
and still to be seen in the Paris Missal, published by his son Jacques in
1559. I have seen also engravings of the artist with the initials I, L, B
(cited by M. Robert-Dumesnil under the date of 1599), in a book of 1547.</p>

<p>These facts do not tend to contradict my proposition; they prove that
Tory founded a school, and that his pupils adopted his mark (which is
nothing more than his initial, or, rather, his toret, transferred from the
Pot Cassé, of which it was the essential feature, to his engravings), adding
thereto their initials, to distinguish themselves from the master whose
ensign they hoisted, and to preserve their own individuality. I shall recur
to this subject later.</p>

<p>The principal reason which prevented M. Renouvier from attributing
to Tory, as he was naturally inclined to do, the engravings marked
with the double cross alone, was the impossibility, in his judgement, of
attributing them all to the same artist. 'M. Robert-Dumesnil,' he says,
'has noted a large number of books of 1522 to 1599, on the title-pages
and plates of which the cross of Lorraine is found. This list might be
increased, and the items should be carefully compared by whoever would
try to find on them the mark of a wood-engraving establishment, or of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
several engravers on wood who worked for the booksellers Pierre Gaudoul,
Simon de Colines, Robert Estienne, Grouleau, Gilles Corrozet, Vincent
Sertenas,<a name="FNanchor_291_291" id="FNanchor_291_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_291_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a> etc.'</p>

<p>I have already answered the objection based upon M. Robert-Dumesnil's
book, which he himself has abandoned with great pleasure, taking
a deep interest in my discovery.<a name="FNanchor_292_292" id="FNanchor_292_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_292_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a> As for what M. Renouvier adds, it does
not run counter to my suggestion, for I have already mentioned that,
after Tory's death, his widow carried on his engraving establishment for
several years, retaining the same mark. This, doubtless, is the explanation
of the differences to be noticed in the works signed with the Lorraine
cross; for Perrette le Hullin, not being an engraver herself, must have
employed different workmen.</p>

<p>This leads me to answer an objection that has been made to my
theory. My attention has been called to the fact that the Lorraine cross
appears on works anterior to Tory,&mdash;such, for example, as the mark of
Gauthier Lud, the first printer of Saint-Dié in Lorraine. I have no purpose
to claim the Lorraine cross for Tory alone. He was not its inventor,
nor did it die with him; but there is a distinction to be made between
an emblem employed in a general way, and one employed as the special
mark of an artist. Not only do I not claim for Tory the Lorraine cross surmounting
a circle, which appears on the mark of the Lorraine printer,
Gauthier Lud,<a name="FNanchor_293_293" id="FNanchor_293_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_293_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a> in 1507, but I exclude the Lorraine cross surmounting a
large gothic G, found on the title-page of a folio Missal according to the
use of the church of Toul, printed at Paris by Wolfgang Hopyl, in 1508.<a name="FNanchor_294_294" id="FNanchor_294_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_294_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a>
To my mind nothing could be more natural than that the Lorraine cross
should be used in Lorraine; but that does not prove that an artist at
Bourges may not have adopted it as the mark of his establishment.</p>

<p>I mention hereafter as one of Tory's first engravings on wood the
title-page of a book printed at Meaux in 1522, and I then say that the
preface of that book was dated 'Meldis, anno <span class="smcapa">M. D. XXI</span>.'<a name="FNanchor_295_295" id="FNanchor_295_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_295_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a> M. Brunet
makes me say,<a name="FNanchor_296_296" id="FNanchor_296_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_296_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a> I cannot imagine why, 'Metis' instead of 'Meldis'; and
M. Didot, misled by that statement, says that the book in question was
published at Metz,<a name="FNanchor_297_297" id="FNanchor_297_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_297_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a> which fact seems to him to explain the presence of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
the Lorraine cross on the title. This shows how an error may be appealed
to in support of a theory.</p>

<p>Not only have I not exaggerated the part played by my hero, as authors
are somewhat in the habit of doing,&mdash;on the contrary, I have restricted
it as much as possible. Since the publication of my first edition,
an attempt has been made to prove Tory to be the maker, or, at least,
the decorator, of the beautiful Henri II porcelains, so-called, the subject
of a recent publication of MM. Delange, father and son. M. Didot himself
adopted this opinion,<a name="FNanchor_298_298" id="FNanchor_298_298"></a><a href="#Footnote_298_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a> which is based upon a vague similarity, but is
completely refuted by the date of Tory's death. So far as I am concerned,
appearances are of no consequence, unless they are accompanied by some
substantial evidence; and that is why I have excluded from the list of
Tory's works some engravings that Messrs. Renouvier and Didot do not
hesitate to attribute to him because of certain similarities, but which do
not bear his mark. It is that mark which has served me as a guide in identifying
Tory's work. The objection is made, to be sure, that this plan requires
the attribution to Tory of engravings of very dissimilar styles. Every
plan has its disadvantages; but, all things considered, I prefer one that has
something to stand upon to one that has nothing. Moreover, it is easy to
explain the different styles of the artist of the Lorraine cross by referring
to what has often taken place in the careers of other artists. In truth, how
many painters have we seen change their style of painting at a certain
period of their lives! But there is an even simpler way of explaining these
dissimilarities in different engravings, namely, by admitting with me that
the Lorraine cross was the mark of Tory's workshop, but that in that workshop
there were other artists of very diverse abilities. In the same way, we
see to-day a multitude of engravings signed 'Andrew,' 'Best,' 'Leloir,' to
which those artists certainly never put their hands.</p>

<p>But let us have done with argument and come to the facts: they will
prove more conclusively than any number of dissertations the truth of
our statement concerning Tory; they will prove, in fact, that all the
works signed by the cross alone were engraved during that artist's lifetime,
or in the establishment which he founded and which his widow retained
until about 1556.</p>

<p>To make the demonstration clearer, I will divide what I still have to
say into three sections. In the first I will include all the manuscripts the
decoration of which can be attributed to Tory; in the second I will describe
all the engravings marked with the Lorraine cross that are known<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
to me, arranging them in chronological order; and in the third I will
mention such marks of printer-booksellers bearing the aforesaid cross,
as I have been able to discover. As it is impossible for me to follow the
chronological order in this last category, I have adopted the alphabetical
order, which will enable one to find at once such of these marks as are
mentioned in the second section.</p>

<p>For a description of these two manuscripts<a name="FNanchor_299_299" id="FNanchor_299_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_299_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a> I cannot do better than transcribe
in this place the interesting work of Comte Léon de Laborde. I
print this work just as it was published several years ago, having no authority
to modify it. But I think that I may venture to say that if it had
been prepared since the publication of my book on Tory, it would contain
a judgement in his favour. That seems to me to be the result of my
conversations with M. de Laborde. My friend M. Jules Renouvier, whose
death is so deeply to be deplored, and in whose company I examined the
volume of the 'Commentaires' in the Bibliothèque Nationale, was entirely
of my opinion. He spoke of the manuscript in question in these
terms in a critical review of the first edition of my book on Tory, printed
in the 'Revue Universelle des Arts' for September, 1857 (vol. v, no. 6,
p. 511):&mdash;</p>

<p>'The point that we knew least about was Tory's début in the career
of an artist. It was most brilliant if we agree with M. Bernard that he
was the author of the miniatures found in two well-known manuscripts,
the "Commentaires de César" in three volumes and the "Triomphes de
Pétrarque," in which we find the signatures "G," and "Godefroy," and the
dates 1519 and 1520. M. de Laborde has recently described them with all
the care that they deserve, without discovering who this Godefroy was.
He was no other than Geofroy Tory, says M. Bernard, and this opinion
is plausible; for, if the subsequent work of the engraver on wood does
not fulfil the promise of the miniaturist, the drawing is governed by
identical characteristics, and the similarity of style is striking, especially
when we consider the engravings that are nearest in point of time, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
those of "Champ fleury," dated 1526. Considered from this point of view,
Geofroy Tory is the most precocious of the artists of the Renaissance:
before the masters of Fontainebleau, he introduced the stately, graceful
and individualized figures, which aroused enthusiasm in the time of
François I, to which Italy lent much of her style, and Germany a little
of her force, but which were more thoroughly French than is generally
admitted. It is well known, moreover, that these miniatures were originally,
even in the "camaieu" process, heightened in effect by chatoyant
tones, with subtleties of drawing which denote a hand more apt to
handle the pencil than the brush, and altogether adapted to the tools of
the engraver. The draughtsman loses a part of his distinction in passing
from a privileged to a commonplace form of art; but so the progress
of art willed.'</p>

<p>The work of M. Léon de Laborde follows:&mdash;</p>


<p class="p6">G<span class="smcapa">ODEFROY</span>, P<span class="smcapa">AINTER TO</span> F<span class="smcapa">RANÇOIS</span> I.</p>

<p>Godefroy has left us, in four small volumes,&mdash;the first three entitled
'Commentaires de César,' the fourth 'Triomphes de Pétrarque'&mdash;the
proof of a fruitful imagination, of a talent in portrait-painting no less
flexible than varied, and of a superiority original with himself, and thoroughly
French,&mdash;a very unusual combination of the qualities peculiar to
our school prior to the formation of the school of Fontainebleau, and of
the qualities&mdash;or, to speak more accurately, the defects&mdash;which that colony
of foreign artists was soon to introduce in our midst.</p>

<p>These four volumes, after divers vicissitudes, repose at last, at the end
of their journeyings and safe from the risk of destruction, the first in the
British Museum at London, the second in the Bibliothèque Nationale at
Paris, the third in the collection of H. R. H. the Duc d'Aumale, and the
fourth in the Bibliothèque de l'Arsenal. I will describe first the 'Commentaires
de César,' a beautiful manuscript, the three volumes of which
I have had before me one by one. There are in this work three things
worthy of remark, to which I shall direct the reader's attention for a
brief space. First, the composition of the work; second, the painting of
the decorations; and lastly, the portraits.</p>

<p>The author, a native of Flanders or Artois, transplanted to the Court
of France, displays no overplus of wit or imagination. He supposes that
King François I, in one of his excursions, or while hunting, meets Julius
Cæsar, and that they converse. The subject of their dialogue is the Gallic
war; it is a sort of commentary on Cæsar's Commentaries, with transparent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
allusions to the events of the reign of François I. It is in these allusions
that we detect the author's predilection for the Belgæ,<a name="FNanchor_300_300" id="FNanchor_300_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_300_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a> with whose country
he is familiar, and particularly for the city of Tournay,<a name="FNanchor_301_301" id="FNanchor_301_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_301_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a> which may
well have been his native place. I do not propose to draw any inference
from his hatred of the English<a name="FNanchor_302_302" id="FNanchor_302_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_302_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a>; although more violent in our northern
provinces than elsewhere, that sentiment was then universal in France.
It would seem, at least so far as the implements of war are concerned, that
the painter who was employed to embellish the manuscript worked under
the author's direction. We find in several places remarks like this: 'The
tower is sufficiently described by the engines that I have caused to be drawn
herein.'</p>

<p>For the rest, we feel that we have to do with a conscientious author;
and simply by the extracts which follow, we may recognize the man
who is uncertain and hesitates, the student who leaves every one in possession
of his rights and who confides his doubts to the reader. On the
eighth leaf of volume two he has instructed Godefroy, the painter, to
reproduce an antique medallion; he writes in the margin: 'I fear that it
is not that Cassius who was a conspirator in the death of Cæsar, for his
name was Caius Cassius, and I find on the medallion Quintus Cassius.'
As to one of the pictures of machines of war he makes this comment:
'Certain pictures of implements of war, as they are portrayed by Frère
Jocunde in book x of Vitruvius.' Beside another, he says: 'I am not the
inventor of the machines which follow, for I found them in a book that
I secured long ago at Chastellerault, at the Lyon d'or.'</p>

<p>To this curious piece of information let us add another,<a name="FNanchor_303_303" id="FNanchor_303_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_303_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a> which tells
us that the author of the book was in relations with an artist of Blois,
a clock-maker and inventive genius: 'The two pictures that follow [two
warlike machines] were taken from a book that Julian, clock-maker at
Bloys, gave me.&mdash;Julian is a man of great wit and knows many things.'</p>

<p>A passage on folio xxii verso of the second volume seems to prove
that the manuscript was written during the years 1519 and 1520: 'By
the map [a map of Gaul] placed at the beginning of the translation of the
first book made at Saint Germain en Laye in the month of April in the
year one thousand five hundred nineteen, you will see clearly who the
Belgæ are.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>

<p>After the author, it is proper to speak of the calligrapher who wrote
the manuscript; but there is nothing to be said save that it is in a fair
hand. The painter Godefroy deserves more consideration and careful attention.
Let us not forgot that we are dealing with a perfectly well-fixed
time, limited to the years 1519 and 1520; let us, at the same time, recall
the great national movement in art in France from 1450 to 1500, the Italian
campaigns, the arrival of artists and objects of art from Italy during
the reigns of Charles VIII and Louis XII, and lastly, and above all, the sojourn
in France of the two great Italian masters, Leonardo da Vinci and
Andrea del Sarto, from 1515 to 1518. Born and trained amid such influences,
a French painter undertakes to decorate a manuscript for King
François I. What does he do to satisfy the prevailing taste, the fashion,
without denying his past? He divides his talent into two parts,<a name="FNanchor_304_304" id="FNanchor_304_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_304_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a> and devotes
one, the French part, to the portraits, the other, the Italian imitation,
to the decorations; in both he gives proof of abundant talent. In the
one case, an exact, shrewd observer, he paints faces by faithfully reproducing
their individual traits; in the other, fertile, never the same, abounding
in resources in the ensemble and the details of his compositions, he
is the pupil of Leonardo da Vinci, with suggestions of Mantegna and the
artists of the first Italian Renaissance in the proportion of the figures, in
the ungracefulness of the attitudes, and in the types of the heads.</p>

<p>From this period, from these influences, and not from Primaticcio,
who was himself subjected to them, dates the Fontainebleau school. It
was adapted to the figure and the type of beauty of Diana de Poitiers;
she encouraged it; but, I say again, it was formed, it was current, before
the reign of the mistress of Henri II and before the painter who is its
most characteristic expression. If we seek to discover what method of
execution was adopted by Godefroy, we see that his portraits are charming
miniatures, comparable with the finest examples that we have of
French miniature-painting; as for the drawings,<a name="FNanchor_305_305" id="FNanchor_305_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_305_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a> there are some that are
almost grisailles, almost coloured&mdash;a mongrel and conventional scheme,
of very doubtful taste. The painter drew his whole subject with the pen,
with a sureness of touch which, it must be said, has no parallel in such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
microscopical dimensions, especially with respect to the faces and the
landscapes; then he laid in the general outline, with the brush and with
sepia, in flat tones, rather lacking in life. Thus far he did not depart from
the canons of art; but he added coloured costumes, suits of armour, gilded
trappings, and a multitude of details which flutter about in his grisaille
and depart from nature in a most extraordinary way. I have said that his
figures are reminiscences of Italian works. We find among them Donatellesque
forms, profiles perdus, and bold gestures that recall Mantegna,
Perugino-like graceful attitudes and ways of carrying the head, and, in
spite of everything, a French background, and points of resemblance to
Holbein, which might be taken to signify that Godefroy had never seen
Italy. Our national Renaissance had made such progress in nearly a century
that our artists needed only a few drawings, a few engravings, with the
impulsion given by Leonardo da Vinci and Andrea del Sarto, to enter that
Italian current. It may be that our compatriot, like Holbein, was subjected
to this influence from afar, at second hand, without having crossed the
mountains.</p>

<p><em>First volume.</em><a name="FNanchor_306_306" id="FNanchor_306_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_306_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a>&mdash;The book opens with a map of Gaul, and we read
on the verso of the first leaf the following passage, written within a cartouche:
'Françoys, by the grace of God, King of France, a second Cæsar,
vanquisher and subduer of the Souycez [Swiss], on the last day of April,
one month after the birth of his second son, in his park of Sainct-Germain-en-Laye,
fell in with Julius Cæsar and questioned him shrewdly concerning
the contents of the first book of the Commentaries.' In another cartouche
is a passage of which we need transcribe no more than the first
words: 'Cæsar, first subjugator of the Helvecez [Helvetii, Swiss], graciously
made reply to him,' etc.</p>

<p>On the third leaf Godefroy has painted the portrait of François I, head
and shoulders alone, in a medallion. He wears his usual costume and the
cap, without a feather, adorned with a banner. His features and his whole
countenance are idealized&mdash;they are a little stiff and sharp; the artist
has sought to produce an ideal antique head. The first miniature, on the
verso of the fifth leaf, bears the date 1519, with no monogram; the others&mdash;folios
9, 13, 17, 21, 23, 31, 33, 36, 43, 53, 60, and so on to the end&mdash;are
signed with a G, and dated the same year. On the miniature painted
on the recto of folio 53, the initial of the artist's name is traced on the
trunk of a tree from which hangs a small cartouche with the words,
'Besanson, 1519.' To be sure, the corresponding passage in the text requires<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
that the miniature in question should represent that venerable city,
but a certain precision in the details, and a sort of predilection manifested
in the care bestowed upon the execution, lead me to believe that the view
was painted after nature, and that Godefroy was attached to that city by
some bond.</p>

<p>I have already spoken of the special characteristics of these miniatures,
and I will mention here only the one on folio 23, which represents the
building of a bridge over the Saône. In the foreground we see figures
reminiscent of the painter Mantegna in their activity, their vigour, and
a certain almost antique grace. The artist has retained the long pointed
shoes to mark the Frenchman; this is an ill-timed display of archæological
learning.</p>

<p>The volume, a large octavo, shaped like a notebook, contains 76 leaves,
including the map. It is in its original binding of red morocco, with ornaments
of wreaths of fleurs-de-lis, stamped with small tools. One can see
the marks of the ribbons which were used to close it and to keep the vellum
from puckering. On the recto of the first leaf, below the map of
Gaul, are the words: 'Bibliothecæ Christophori Justelli.' This note, while
it establishes the antiquity of the manuscript, also explains its emigration
to England. Christophe Justel, Councillor and Secretary to the King,
died at Paris in 1649, at the age of seventy, leaving to his son, together
with the taste for study, a valuable collection of books and manuscripts.
Among the latter was this first volume of the 'Commentaires de César.'
Henri Justel succeeded his father in the office of Secretary to the King;
also in his literary studies and in the liberality with which his library and
house were thrown open to scholars. The letters of all the learned men of
the time bear witness to his hospitality offered to learning.</p>

<p>He published at Paris, in 1661, the 'Bibliotheca juris canonici veteris
ex antiquis codd. mss. bibliothecæ Christophori Justelli,' in two folio volumes,
and he seemed destined to pursue in peace his erudite career. But
the tempest called the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes was preceded,
for far-seeing Protestants, by premonitory signs which were enough for
Henri Justel. He packed up his books and crossed to England, where he
was appointed Librarian to the King&mdash;an office which he held until his
death in 1698. The manuscript of the 'Commentaires' was probably purchased
at the sale of his library by Robert Harley, Earl of Oxford. The
Lord Treasurer of England (1661-1724) found consolation for the ingratitude
of men in forming that magnificent collection, which retains the
name of the Harleian Collection in the British Museum.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>

<p>Our manuscript, however, reached that haven only with the second
part of Robert Harley's books and manuscripts, in 1754.</p>

<p><em>Second Volume.</em><a name="FNanchor_307_307" id="FNanchor_307_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_307_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a>&mdash;The first miniature represents François I on horseback,
in hunting costume, wearing the chapeau with plumes. The King
is urging his horse to the right. Above his head a crowned F in gold stands
out against the blue background of a shield. This was a device for disclosing
his identity to those who were not struck by the likeness. In the
middle distance is a huntsman, galloping in the same direction as the
King and blowing his horn. Over his head floats a banderole, bearing
the name 'P<span class="smcapa">EROT</span>.'<a name="FNanchor_308_308" id="FNanchor_308_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_308_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a> On a stone between the legs of the King's horse is
the initial letter of the artist's name; and beneath, in a frame (separated,
however, by a running dog), the date 1519. The border is of the utmost
grace of design, and leaves room for a few words of the text, which begins
thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>'Françoys, by the grace of God King of France, desiring to exercise
his lusty youth by violent labour, early in the month of August in the
year one thousand five hundred nineteen, went forth to course the stag
in the forest of Byevre, and gave order that on that day those dogs should
course which he had chosen to lead the pack, because they are surer
than the others. Gaillart was of the number, as was Gallehault, and pretty
Rameau. Arbault, Gerfault, and Billehault went in their company.</p>

<p>'The King was following the stag very close and was riding at full
speed when he fell in with the chaste Diana. The King was overcome
with joy, and having forgotten his quarry, he was all amazed that the
vision vanished and he remained all alone in deepest thought. But soon
after he saw beside him an ancient man of venerable aspect. He knew
upon hearing him speak that it was his friend Julius Cæsar, whom he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
had met in like manner, only three months before, in his park at Sainte-Germain-en-Laye.'</p>

<p>Thereupon they enter into conversation upon Cæsar's campaigns.</p>

<p>Godefroy's plates, almost all of which are signed with a G and dated
1519, are on these leaves: 2 verso, 3 verso, 4 verso, 5 verso, 7 verso, 9 verso,
20 recto, 22 verso, 28 recto, 33 verso, 34 verso, 36 verso, 37 verso, 43 recto,
46 verso, 48 verso, 59 verso, 62 verso, 78 verso, 90 recto.</p>

<p>The medallions, which are copied from the antique, are admirably
executed in gold on a blue ground, the models being delicately outlined
in sepia. They are on leaves 6 verso, 8 recto, 9 verso, 10 verso, 11 recto and
verso, 12 recto and verso, 13 recto and verso.</p>

<p>Warlike machines, copied from other drawings, and consequently
lacking the life imparted by the representation of real objects, fill leaves
39 recto and verso, 40 recto and verso, 41 recto, 91 recto and verso, 92
recto and verso, 93 recto and verso, 94 recto.</p>

<p>Lastly, the portraits may be found on the leaves which I am now
about to enumerate. I will add nothing to what I have said of their perfection,
generally speaking, reserving my comments for the points of
interest suggested by the manuscript itself. These portraits, as one might
have anticipated, and as is proved by leaf 52 most directly, are copies of
originals which antedate the manuscript. They are painted in miniature,
surrounded by three circles of black and gold; the whole medallion is
fifty-two millimeters in diameter, the miniature forty.</p>

<p>Leaf 25 verso: Quintus Pedius. Such is the title given by the scribe;
but a different hand has written in the margin, in cursive characters:
'Le grand maistre de Boissy, aged 41 years.' I am inclined to see in these
marginal annotations the hand of the author rather than that of the
artist. This portrait is three-quarters full, turned to the left, with a cap
on its head, the hair in a net, a collar of some order around the neck, face
tranquil, expression shrewd.</p>

<p>Leaf 35 recto: Le Fiable Divitiacus Dautun. ('Admiral de Boissy, seigneur
de Bonivet, aged 34 years.') Three-quarters full, turned to the right.</p>

<p>Leaf 36: Quintus Titurius Sabinus. ('Odet de Foues, Sieur de Lautrec,
aged 41 years.') Three-quarters full, turned to the left.</p>

<p>Leaf 42: Iccius. ('Le mareschal de Chabanes, seigneur de la Palice, aged
57 years.') Three-quarters full, turned to the left, expression slightly
haughty.</p>

<p>Leaf 52: Lucius Aruculeius Cotta. ('Anne de Montmorency, aged 22
years, afterwards connestable de France.')</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>

<p>Leaf 73: Publius Sextius Baculus. ('Le mareschal de Fleuranges, son
of Robert de la Marche, first seigneur de Sedan, aged 24 years.') Three-quarters
full, turned to the left.</p>

<p>Leaf 76 verso: Publius Crassus. ('Le sieur de Tournon who was killed
at the battle of Pavia, aged 36 years.') Three-quarters full, turned to the left.</p>

<p>On the verso of leaf 89 we find these words: 'Thus Cæsar made an
end of speaking and forthwith disappeared. The radiant Diana, who
knew the paths of the forest of Bièvre, and of all time was privy to and
understood the laws of the chase, remounted, and by so straight a course
led the King, who had lost the dogs, that within a few hours, near the
forest of Fontainebleau, he saw them hunting better than before. And
he was the first of all at the death of the stag, but he had with him only
pretty Arbault and the beautiful Greffière, for Diana and Aurora had left
him and had gone their ways.'</p>

<p>The two dogs are represented in the miniature; they are attacking
the stag, while the King makes ready to stab him.</p>

<p>This volume, containing 98 leaves, is bound in black morocco, which
has grown rusty; it bears these words stamped in the leather: 'Tomus
Secundus.' It is catalogued in the Supplément Français, as no. 1328. Its
history, as told among the habitués of the Bibliothèque Nationale, is as
follows: M. Van-Praët appeared at the Conservatoire one day with an
exultant air; he had this fascinating manuscript in his hand, and announced
that he had purchased it for the Bibliothèque for 1200 francs.
He expected to gladden the hearts of his comrades, to call forth expressions
of gratitude; far from it; on the contrary, they found fault both
with that method of purchasing, without authority, and with the price
that he had paid. M. Van-Praët made haste to banish the scruples of his
inflexible directors, and to put an end to the unpleasant discussion that
was beginning, by declaring that the purchase had been made for himself
and not for the Bibliothèque; then, when the meeting was adjourned, he
hastened to his friends the brothers Debure, and, with a bursting heart,
told them of his misadventure. They appreciated Van-Praët's regrets too
thoroughly to try to calm them; but they knew also that he was not rich
enough to keep the manuscript, and they bought for their own little collection,
at the price that he had paid, that charming product of French
art, still bleeding from the reception that it had met with at the hands of
the great so-called 'national' collection. Years and years had passed since
this strange performance, when, in 1852, a small package was brought to
M. Naudet, with the information that M. Debure, by his last will, had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
ordered that this manuscript, embellished with paintings by Godefroy,
which had been purchased for the Bibliothèque and spurned by it, should
be restored to it as its property.</p>

<p>One does not know which to admire more in this testamentary disposition
of the famous bookseller&mdash;the keenness of his irony or the nobility
of his act. Without exerting itself overmuch to decide that point
the Conservatoire of the Bibliothèque Impériale welcomed the prodigal
child and deposited it in the Supplément Français. But, with a lingering
remnant of spite, its light was hidden under the bushel of 'la réserve';
which is one way of preventing people from having access to it with the
facility which assists investigations, under the protection of that liberality
which is one of our claims to honour among foreign nations, and which
the government of the Bibliothèque should have preserved, even at the
price of the inconvenience that it might have caused.</p>

<p><em>Third Volume.</em><a name="FNanchor_309_309" id="FNanchor_309_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_309_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a>&mdash;Original binding, with the title: 'Cæsaris liber tertius.'
The text begins thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>'On the twenty-seventh day of February, one thousand five hundred
<span class="smcapa">XX</span>, the King being in his park of Congnac, seeing that the splendour of
his entry was like to be marred by the inclemency of the weather, took
shelter in the house of the labyrinth, having with him monsieur l'Admiral
and the young and discreet Sieur de la Rochepot. At the entrance to the
lower room he feels and hears so violent a wind that it seems to him
"quam spiritu vehementi" the lofty trees fall to the earth as on Friday the
ninth day of March one thousand Vᶜᶜ<span class="smcapa">XX</span> in divers places about Paris.'</p>

<p>The result of all this uproar is the appearance of Julius Cæsar. François
I questions him as to what he did after pacifying Gaul. Whereupon Cæsar
replies:&mdash;</p>

<p>'I tell you that, after divers victories won by me, so high an opinion
of me and so great renown were spread among the barbarian peoples,
that ambassadors were sent to me by the nations beyond the Rhine, who
in the name of their cities promised to give hostages to me and to obey
my commands. But, for that I was in haste to go thence, I bade them
return to me in the summer season. Thereafter I led my legions to winter
quarters in the land of Touraine and in the duchy of Madame your
mother. And that done, I went hence to Italy.'</p>

<p>This volume is supplied with two maps: one, of Aquitaine, is at the
beginning, the other, of Bretagne, at the end of the volume, which contains<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
also no less than twelve large miniatures. The King, in hunting costume,
figures again and again in them. The execution is as careful, and
the paintings of the same type, as in the two earlier volumes. All the miniatures
and the maps are signed with a G, and some of them are dated
1520. On folio 52, the painter's name is written in full: 'Godefroy.'</p>

<p>The former owner of this fine manuscript writes to me: 'I cannot
furnish you with any interesting information concerning the manuscript
of the "Commentaires de César." It was given to me, only the slightest
importance being attached to the gift, by a resident of Tours, who owned
no books, and who had kept it for forty years in his closet. To tell you
how it came into my hands would be the more difficult because that
person has long been dead. The volume was delivered to me in very bad
condition. I employed Duru to repair the back and to rebind it, leaving
intact the covers, which were of the original sixteenth-century binding.
A small engraving, which resembled niello-work, but was recognized as
the work of Étienne de Laulne, an engraver of Orléans, was at the beginning
of the book.'</p>

<p>Obliged, in 1850, by circumstances which it is needless to detail, although
they were to his honour, to part with this precious volume, its
owner sent it to Paris, to M. Techener, for sale on commission. He
wanted 2000 francs for it, and first of all the bookseller offered it to the
Bibliothèque Nationale. The Conservatoire of that great collection could
not find that amount in its annual credit of 80,000 francs, and it renewed
the old joke which had temporarily banished the second volume. Unfortunately
one does not meet every day, to repair its errors, generous booksellers
like M. Debure, or those who have it in their power to be as generous
as he; and M. Techener, who was richer than our rich collection of books
for the purpose of purchasing this manuscript, was not rich enough to
present it to that collection. He advertised it in the 'Bulletin du Bibliophile'
for 1850 (no. 1222), for 3000 francs. During a whole year, artists and
curious folk (I was among the latter) were at liberty to examine it at leisure
and to lament the advent of English dealers who threatened every moment
to take it from us. At last, Monseigneur le Duc d'Aumale added it to his
treasures of printed books and manuscripts, and, although in England, one
may say now that it belongs to France. Indeed, it may be that M. Debure's
example will be followed some day, and that this third volume will come
to join the second on the shelves of our magnificent department of manuscripts,
awaiting the time when the fortunate result of negotiations with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
the British Museum shall permit the consummation of the work by means
of exchanges.<a name="FNanchor_310_310" id="FNanchor_310_310"></a><a href="#Footnote_310_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a></p>

<p>Godefroy's facile talent could not fail to be fruitful of results, and some
of his works may be found in several collections. The Bibliothèque de
l'Arsenal owns one of them, the 'Triomphes de Pétrarque,' which seems,
in view of the exuberance of the subjects, the exaggeration of the artist's
defects, and the laxness of execution, to be of later date than the 'Commentaires
de César'; and, whether because the artist had visited Italy, or
because, the better to interpret the poet's ideas, he sought inspiration in
Italian works, it is certain that he is less French in the illustrations of this
manuscript than in the others. He is more perfect, too, in the art of composition,
his distances are more accurately measured, his groups are more
in harmony with one another; in a word, he displays an inspiration, or resources,
altogether new: such, for example, as the device of cutting off the
figures in the foreground at the waist, by means of rising ground, whereby
he is able to give them strongly proportioned frames without filling up
his whole picture.</p>

<p>I will describe this manuscript briefly. It is a small octavo volume of
ten leaves (not including the covers), written on fine parchment. It is
about 10 centimetres in height by 8 in width. It was rebound in the eighteenth
century, in lemon-colored morocco.</p>

<p>'Here followeth the first of the six triumphs of the most illustrious and
venerable poet Messire Francisque Petrarque: the which is the triumph
of Love and containeth four chapters.'</p>

<p>Chapter I. A miniature painted on pages 2 and 3, which face each other.
It represents the triumph of Love, with a deal of disorder and somewhat
licentious details. The G can be seen in the foreground, in the centre of the
picture, on the ground.</p>

<p>Chapter II. The miniature has been removed.</p>

<p>Chapter III. The miniature occupies the verso of the title of the chapter.
In the foreground are amorous couples discoursing together, some
seated, some walking about. The men wear caps with long feathers, as in
the bas-reliefs of the hôtel de Bourgtheroude. The architectural arrangement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
in the background is charming. Beside a triumphal arch rises the
tower of love. Flames are darting from all its windows, and meanwhile a
long procession of women rushes through the door, followed by a Cupid
with bandaged eyes. The artist has painted his initial on the tower.</p>

<p>Chapter IV. In this miniature, Petrarch's face, twice repeated, seems
to be a reproduction of an original portrait. The G can just be distinguished
on a rock in the foreground; it has been effaced.</p>

<p>'Here followeth the second triumph of Messire Francisque Petrarque,
the which is the triumph of Chastity.'</p>

<p>The miniature occupies two facing pages, but it forms two distinct
pictures. The buildings in the background are arranged in a quasi-Italian
style, but are not a reproduction of any known structure. Godefroy
has placed his G on a tree, at the left, accompanied by three lizards&mdash;a
detail which should not be passed over, for it is repeated several times, as if
the name of those creatures bore some relation to that of the artist.</p>

<p>'Triumph of Death, the which is the third triumph of Petrarque.'</p>

<p>[Chapter I.] This miniature is one of the most interesting and best preserved.
Death, grasping his scythe, stands over the body of a young woman
lying dead on the triumphal chariot. It is, in fact, the Italian triumph, as
we have it represented in so many works. In this case the miniature is in
duplicate, as well as the painting. The G is at the bottom.</p>

<p>Chapter II. Miniature on a single page: the death of Laura. The young
woman is lying on the bed of death. She is surrounded by her friends, with
palms in their hands. Above, in the sky, is seen the form of the Virgin. It
is a very pleasing composition, nearly filling the frame, and the effect is
charming.</p>

<p>Chapter III. Petrarch and Laura are seated in the shade of tall trees, on
the bank of a pond in which two swans are floating. The same two persons
are seen farther back, twice repeated, and diminishing in size according
to the distance. An architectural structure, decidedly Italian in type, closes
the view at the back. The G is painted on a stone at the feet of Petrarch
and Laura. Evidently Godefroy had studied several portraits of the two,
and he copies them with some success in their various attitudes. The trees
are done so skilfully that one might well believe that he could recognize the
touch of a landscape artist, and a generally happy effect gives to this miniature
all the value of a painting.</p>

<p>'Here followeth the fifth triumph of Messire Francisque Petrarque,
the which is the triumph of Time.'</p>

<p>The miniature occupies two pages and includes two subjects. In one,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
Time, represented by the signs of the zodiac, and by the allegorical figures
of antiquity, marks his progress in the sky; mortals undergo his influence
on the earth. The artist has signed his work at the right, at the foot of the
picture, this time with his full name: 'Godefroy.' In the other miniature
the triumph of Time is represented. He is passing in his chariot, drawn by
four horses at a gallop, between the four Seasons. On the left, at the foot,
we see a G and two lizards.</p>

<p>'Here followeth the sixth and last triumph of Messire Francisque
Petrarque, the which is the triumph of the Deity.'</p>

<p>This title is followed by a double miniature. In one, we see God the
Father and Jesus Christ, with the Holy Spirit soaring above their heads,
seated on the globe and presiding at the last day. Flames fall from the skies
upon mankind, who are divided into the good and the bad; angels tranquilly
lead the former, while devils brutally pursue the others. At the foot,
on the right, is the G. On the other page, God the Father and God the
Son (the Holy Spirit hovering over them as before) are seated in a triumphal
chariot drawn by the ox, the lion, the eagle, and the angel, which are
the symbols of the evangelists. They come forward, surrounded by all the
dignitaries of the Church. Pagan Love, with bandaged eyes, lies dead on
the ground near the chariot wheels; a long procession of saints, male and
female, concealed below the waist by an elevation, are following the course
of the chariot in the foreground. This arrangement made it possible for
the artist to make his figures larger and to delineate their features with care.
The G is at the foot of the miniature, on the ground.</p>

<p>All these miniatures, painted in grisaille, with blue skies and water,
and with some few details in colour, are 86 millimetres high and 68 wide.</p>

<p>In the catalogue of the library of M. Firmin Didot père, sold in 1811,
is the following description of a magnificent manuscript:<a name="FNanchor_311_311" id="FNanchor_311_311"></a><a href="#Footnote_311_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a>&mdash;</p>

<p>'The first three books of Diodorus Siculus, translated from Latin into
French by Antoine Macault. Small folio, in blue morocco, with dentelles,
<em>lavé</em>, <em>réglé</em>, bound with the arms of François I, whose cipher it bears on
the back and on the cover.</p>

<p>'A superb manuscript on vellum, presented to François I, containing
173 leaves, 30 lines to the page. It is illustrated with miniatures and with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
a large number of initial letters painted with the utmost care. The first
miniature represents François I surrounded by the nobles and scholars of
his court; it is 10 inches high and 6&frac12; wide. This painting, of the most finished
workmanship, has the additional merit of presenting the features of
several great men of that time. All the pages on which chapters begin
are set in fillets of gold and ultramarine. The initials are 19 lines high and
12 wide. More than fifty of these initials represent the principal subjects
of their respective chapters. The third book is especially noteworthy, for,
beginning with page 130, there is a series of small miniatures, admirable
in execution and of the greatest exactness in respect of forms.</p>

<p>'This manuscript has the advantage of being in a most excellent state
of preservation.'</p>

<p>It was sold to M. Brunet, author of the 'Manuel du Libraire,' for 1476
francs (not including the usual expenses); he bought for William Beckford,
Esq., of Fonthill Abbey in the County of Wilts, of which Salisbury is
the shire town. The author of the 'Repertorium Bibliographicum,' printed
at London in 1819, informs us that Macault's manuscript was at that time
in the library of that distinguished collector, which is described on pages
203 to 230 of the 'Repertorium.'<a name="FNanchor_312_312" id="FNanchor_312_312"></a><a href="#Footnote_312_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a></p>

<p>'This fine manuscript, formerly in the possession of Francis the First, appears
to have been executed by his express command. Prefixed to the history
is a painting of the King seated under a canopy powdered with fleurs-de-lis,
surrounded by his courtiers: his three sons, the Dauphin Francis,
Henry, afterwards Henry II, and Charles, Duke of Orleans, dressed in rich
habits, appear in the foreground. The King seems to direct his attention
to a person reading, dressed as an ecclesiastic, probably the translator of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
History. A beautiful greyhound on the floor, and a marmoset, sitting on
the table, near the King's left hand, are prominent figures in the groupe
[<em>sic</em>]. In addition to this exquisite illumination, the volume is enriched with
numerous large initial letters, painted with peculiar delicacy, representing
occurrences described in the book, manners of various nations, and portraits
of their early emperors and kings.'<a name="FNanchor_313_313" id="FNanchor_313_313"></a><a href="#Footnote_313_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a></p>

<p>This description is accompanied by an engraving on copper of the
figure of François I, after the Macault MS. The King is depicted full face,
seated before a table on which, near his left hand, is a monkey. The background
is a tapestry covered with fleurs-de-lis. This engraving is dated July
1, 1817, and is the work of M. Behnes. It differs from the engraving on
wood found in Macault's printed volume, not only in that it does not include
the various persons of the original drawing, but also in the details
of the King's costume. I have every reason to believe that the wood engraving
is a faithful reproduction of the original, just as the book itself is
a reproduction of the manuscript, except for the other drawings, which
were omitted, from economical motives, no doubt.</p>

<p>Macault's volume is a quarto, consisting of 8 leaves of preface, 154 of
text (signatures A to Q), and 8 of index. The author's preface begins
with an S from which depends a shield (probably Macault's), bearing two
fasces accompanied by nine bezants arranged in threes, and having for a
motto the Greek word <span class="smcapa">ΜΗΚΕΤΙ</span> (not at all). The letter is repeated on folio
148. The first page has a border in the shape of a portico, like those in the
opuscula published by Tory in 1531 and described on pp. 202-203. At the
foot is the date 1535. On the verso we find the final border of 'Champ fleury,'
within which are drawn, in the vellum copy preserved at the Bibliothèque
Nationale, the royal arms of England, with the motto <span class="smcapa">DIEV EST</span> [<em>sic</em>]

<p>The dedicatory epistle of this book, which was at first intended to be
addressed to François's third son, Charles de Valois, as the author informs
us, was addressed to the Dauphin, Henri, afterwards Henri II, who succeeded
to the rights of his elder brother, deceased in 1536, and of his
younger brother, who died in 1545. It is dated at Rome, the 4th of the
Kalends of April (March 29), 1547.</p>

<p>As we see, the book was originally intended to stop with François I;
but as circumstances prevented the author from printing it thus, du Tillet
included the reigns of Henri II, François II, and Charles IX, who succeeded
one another at brief intervals. The work was still unpublished
when the author died, in 1570; it would seem, however, that he had long
been preparing to print, since we find in the edition of 1580 engravings
signed with the Lorraine cross.<a name="FNanchor_317_317" id="FNanchor_317_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_317_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a></p>

<p>In 'Les Récréations historiques,' by Dreux Duradier, on page 102 of

unable to find it.</p>


<p class="p6">7</p>

<p>In order to omit nothing, I will also mention here another valuable
manuscript of the Bibliothèque Nationale, on one of the miniatures of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
which is a G, followed by a small <span class="smcapa">T</span> or <span class="smcapa">F</span>, which may fairly be attributed
to Geofroy Tory. It is a translation of Livy, in two large folio volumes,
on vellum, acquired from the Bibliothèque de la Sorbonne, and enriched
with magnificent engravings, attributed to Jean Fouquet, which, however,
cannot be his, for the book has, on the first page, the arms of François
de Rochechouart and Blanche d'Aumont, who were married about
1480 and died, both, in 1530. Evidently it was not in the early years of
their marriage that the book was written; and, as it must have occupied
several years, and, in fact, was never finished, there is nothing extraordinary
in the idea that Tory may have executed some of the miniatures
about 1520. Furthermore, in order to place the reader in a position to
judge for himself, I will add that the cipher mentioned above is painted
on the leg of the figures in the miniature on page 123 of volume one.<a name="FNanchor_318_318" id="FNanchor_318_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_318_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a></p>

<p class="p6">1515</p>

<p>There appeared for the first time, in the books of Hours published by
Simon Vostre about 1515, three engravings which are clearly distinguishable
in method of execution from those previously used by the same bookseller,
to which the three new ones were thereafter added.</p>

<p>Thenceforth Vostre's Hours contained three varieties of engraving:
(1) The old gothic woodcuts (among which must be reckoned the Dance
of Death with dotted background), which figure in the editions issued
by that bookseller even in the fifteenth century; (2) Two large drawings
in the Renaissance style, which appear in his editions of 1507 and which
may be attributed to Jean Perreal, Tory's teacher; (3) The three in question,
which do not appear earlier than 1514 or 1515. These engravings are:
(<span class="smcapa">I</span>) The Adoration of the Shepherds, signed with the letter G in a gothic
shield; (<span class="smcapa">II</span>) The Adoration of the Magi; (<span class="smcapa">III</span>) The Circumcision; the last
two signed with this monogram: <img src="images/i_b_172.png" width="35" height="26" alt="" />. The G is still inclined to the gothic,
but the second letter is altogether roman. In my judgement, this monogram
should be translated by the words, 'Godofredus faciebat,' or 'fecit.' It is true
that the ascription of these engravings to Tory has been contested; but
Jules Renouvier, whose taste was so unerring, and who cannot be accused
of infatuation for Tory, did not hesitate to adopt my hypothesis. 'In the last
of Vostre's Hours,' he says, in the pamphlet that he published concerning
that bookseller, 'we see, besides the plates executed in the old French manner,
which have not disappeared as yet, other plates in the Italian and German
manners, subjects treated in an altogether novel style: the Adoration
of the Shepherds, the Adoration of the Kings, and the Circumcision, are
composed of small figures in a large ground; the design has recovered all
its delicacy, in its clearly drawn forms, and the cutting is done with no less
diversity than care. Here, luckily,' continues Renouvier, 'a monogram enables
us to attribute the engravings to their author. It is a G alone, or enclosing
an <span class="smcapa">F</span>, subscribed on a shield or in a cartouche hanging from a branch.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
They have been claimed for Geofroy Tory, and with good reason, for the
manner in which these plates are executed accords with what we know
of that excellent artist.'</p>

<p>It is, perhaps, to these engravings, so successfully executed, that we
should ascribe the partiality that Tory afterwards displayed for books of
Hours, of which, as we have seen, he put forth several editions, in diverse
formats, and with a large number of engravings on wood done by himself.</p>


<p class="p6">1516-1518</p>

<p>Here is to be placed Tory's second journey to Rome,<a name="FNanchor_319_319" id="FNanchor_319_319"></a><a href="#Footnote_319_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a> from which he
returned more Italian than ever, in respect to art.</p>


<p class="p6">1519-1520</p>

<p>Under this date, which was when Tory was working at the manuscripts
I have described above, I shall place, albeit somewhat conjecturally,
two small engravings on wood, signed with the letters G T, which appear
in a publication of M. Varlot entitled: 'Illustration de l'ancienne
imprimerie troyenne' (4to, 1850). They are numbers 84 and 131, the first
in the criblé style, the second in the style of the Renaissance. My ascription
of them to Tory is based upon the facts that they are of his time, as
we may infer from the one in the criblé style, and that the initials G T
are entirely consistent with that period of the life of our artist, who sometimes
signed his name in full, Geofroy Tory, as witness his Hours of 1524.</p>

<p>The first of these engravings, number 84, represents a Descent from the
Cross. The letters G T are at the foot of the plate, and are some distance
apart.<a name="FNanchor_320_320" id="FNanchor_320_320"></a><a href="#Footnote_320_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a> In the same collection there is another engraving of the same series,
but not signed&mdash;number 78. It represents a bishop blessing a sick man who
lies entirely nude before him. These two are 48 millimetres wide by 62 high.</p>

<p>Number 131 represents a scene from Terence. The letters G T are side
by side at the foot of the plate, which is 33 millimetres high by 55 wide.
In the same collection, numbers 132 and 133, are two other woodcuts of
the same series, but not signed. Lastly, in an edition of Æsop, published
recently at Troyes, by the printer Baudot, we find a woodcut which probably
had the same origin, and found its way into this volume by chance.
These four engravings are evidently from an edition of Terence in a small
format; I have been unable to find it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span></p>

<p class="p6">1520-1521</p>

<p>I shall place under this date a title-page, in octavo, forming a border,
engraved for Simon de Colines, and bearing his mark and his initials.
This printer, who succeeded in 1520 Henri Estienne, the first of the name,
whose widow he married, wished to mark his printings in some special
way, and to that end applied to Tory, who was a friend of the family.
Tory engraved the title-page in question, in the criblé style, then much
in vogue; and on it are seen rabbits, or <em>conils</em>, which is believed to be an allusion
to the name of Colines.<a name="FNanchor_321_321" id="FNanchor_321_321"></a><a href="#Footnote_321_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a> Tory's mark appears in white, at the foot of
the engraving, to the right. I have seen this engraving in an Epitome of
the 'Adages' of Erasmus, in Latin, printed by Simon de Colines, in 1523,
in octavo, under this title: 'Johannis Brucherii Trecensis Adagiorum ad
studiosæ juventutis utilitatem ex Erasmicis chiliadibus excerptorum epitome.'
It was probably Tory, too, who engraved Colines's large mark with
the rabbits (Silvestre, no. 79), which is in the same style, and which appears
in the Hours of 1524; but it does not bear the double cross. Tory also
engraved for Colines two other marks in a very different style (Silvestre,
nos. 80 and 329), and a multitude of borders and illustrations for his books.</p>

<p>Colines certainly employed Tory more than any other printer did, as we
shall see in the sequel. This fact leads me to believe that Lottin is mistaken
in bestowing upon Colines the title of engraver of letters, attributing to
him doubtless the engraving of the graceful italics that he used in works
written in verse; I am convinced that those letters are the work of Tory.
I will call attention, however, to the fact that the capitals that go with these
italics are roman, and may belong to the roman letters which Simon de
Colines had from Henri Estienne. But the font is enriched with some
white two-line letters, of a charming design, which are certainly Tory's,
as are the floriated letters used by Colines and his stepson Robert Estienne.</p>


<p class="p6">1521-1522</p>

<p><span class="smcapa">I.</span> Tory engraved also for Simon de Colines a magnificent title-page
intended for a very rare work, which, for that reason, I think that I ought
to describe in detail (after one of the copies in the Bibliothèque Nationale),
for its existence has been doubted.<a name="FNanchor_322_322" id="FNanchor_322_322"></a><a href="#Footnote_322_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a></p>

<p>The book is entitled: 'Commentarii initiatorii in quatuor Evangelia,'
etc., with no author's name on the title-page; but it was written by Jacques<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
Lefèvre d'Etaples, as we shall see in a moment. It is a folio, of 6 unnumbered
preliminary leaves, and of 377 numbered leaves, making 192
sheets, divided into 50 folds of 4 sheets each, except the first, which has
only 3. The signatures go from <em>a</em> to <em>ddd</em> consecutively. The text of the
Gospels is set in large type (great primer), the notes in smaller type
(pica), in which there are some very handsome Greek characters, with
accents, which were still a novelty at that time.</p>

<p>The title is in a wide border, engraved on wood, decorated with the
symbols of the four evangelists, beneath which are printed passages from
their works. This border, which is signed with the Lorraine cross at the
foot, on the right side, is .225 metre high by .166 wide.</p>

<p>On the second preliminary leaf the author's preface begins, under this
heading: 'Jacobi Fabri Stapulensis ad Christianos lectores in sequens
opus Præfatio.' It ends on the fourth preliminary leaf, with the date, 'Meldis,
anno <span class="smcapa">M. D. XXI</span>.' Then follows a concordance of the four Gospels, in
the form of tablets closed at top and bottom by unsigned engravings.</p>

<p>The Gospel according to St. Matthew, which opens the book, begins
with a superb ornamented L, on a criblé background, .058 metre in
height by .055 in width. The Gospel according to St. Mark, which opens
on leaf 115 (erroneously printed 215), begins with an I of the same style
and dimensions. The Gospel according to St. Luke begins on folio 175
verso, with an F like the two preceding letters. The Gospel according
to St. John begins on folio 259, with the I that has already done duty
in the Gospel of St. Mark. These letters, which are altogether in the
style of those afterwards engraved by Tory for Robert Estienne, seem to
me to be fairly attributable to him, although unsigned.</p>

<p>In the balance of the book we find a large number of other letters ornamented
in the criblé style, but of smaller size, which cannot be Tory's.</p>

<p>On folios 101 verso and 102 recto are certain astronomical figures, unsigned,
which I dare not attribute to Tory; but I do not hesitate to attribute
to him a large engraving on folio 182 verso. It represents Jesus in an
aureole of flame. Below him is the sea; above him the Father Everlasting,
blessing with the right hand, and holding in his left hand the globe surmounted
by a cross. He is uttering these words which we read in a scroll:
'Hic est filius meus dilectus in quo mihi bene complacui.' This engraving,
including its border, is .210 metre in height by .137 wide.</p>

<p>On the last page is a subscription in these words: <span class="smcapa">MELDIS</span>,
<span class="smcapa">IMPENSIS SIMONIS COLINAEI ANNO SALVTIS HVMANAE</span> <span class="smcapa">M. D. XXII</span>. <span class="smcapa">MENSE IVNIO</span>.</p>

<p>Who printed this book? Not Simon de Colines, as La Caille said, and as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
Maittaire and Panzer have repeated after him, for the subscription means
simply that the printing was done at his expense. One can understand, in
truth, that Simon de Colines, who had at the time an extensive typographical
establishment at Paris in full blast, could not leave that city to print a
book at Meaux. Nor was it a local printer, for no other contemporary printing
at Meaux is known; moreover, the mechanical execution of this volume,
and the engravings with which it is embellished, prove that it did not
come from a wretched provincial workshop.</p>

<p>In my opinion there is but one way of explaining this typographical
enigma. It is this: Guillaume Briçonnet (second of the name), having been
appointed Bishop of Meaux in 1518, took with him to that town his friend
Lefèvre d'Etaples, to whom he entrusted the administration of his diocese.
Etaples employed his leisure in writing various religious works, among
others the Commentaries on the Gospels, which were finished in 1521. Wishing
to have this bulky volume, which was of capital importance to him,
printed under his own eyes, and being unable to leave Meaux, where he
was detained by his duties, Lefèvre simply imported from Paris a portion
of Simon de Colines's printing-office, with a small staff.<a name="FNanchor_323_323" id="FNanchor_323_323"></a><a href="#Footnote_323_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a> In this way he
could not only superintend the printing of his book, but also lend a hand
at need, after the example of many another scholar of that time who did
not scorn to practise the printing art.</p>

<p>What I have said is a mere hypothesis, it is true; but this hypothesis
is surrounded by circumstances which give it a powerful appearance of
truth. In addition to what I have said above, I will say that the types of
Lefèvre d'Etaples' book are the same as those used in an octavo printed
at Paris by Simon de Colines in 1523,&mdash;a book which I have already cited
and which I now have before me. It is entitled: 'Joannis Brucherii Trecensis
Adagiorum ... ex Erasmicis chiliadibus excerptorum Epitome.' The
title-page has a border signed with the Lorraine cross. More than that, the
first ornamental letter in Etaples' book, which is an A on a criblé background,
is also the first letter of the book of Johannes Brucherius; whence
we see that the typographical material sent to Meaux returned to Paris
immediately after Etaples' book was printed.</p>

<p>Doubtless that is why we have only one book dated at Meaux at that
period; it might be, however, that advantage was taken of the momentary
existence of this printing-office at Meaux to set up some trifling work,
in 1521 or 1522; but that would not in any wise modify my conclusion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcapa">II.</span> Tory engraved also, at about the same time, for a printer at Troyes
named Jean Lecoq, the title-page, in the shape of a border, of a 'Gradual'<a name="FNanchor_324_324" id="FNanchor_324_324"></a><a href="#Footnote_324_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a>
of the Cistercian Order&mdash;a very large and handsome folio, printed at
Troyes in 1521. This engraving is in the criblé style, with the double
cross in white at the foot, on the right. At about the same time he engraved
in the same style Jean Lecoq's mark, which appears at the end of
the volume, and of which a reproduction may be seen in M. Silvestre's
book, no. 875.</p>

<p>As this Gradual is very rare (only one copy of it is known to exist, which
I have seen in M. Tross's collection) and very beautiful, I think it well to
describe it. It is almost needless to say that it is printed in gothic type.</p>

<p>First of all, above the title there is a line printed in black:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">Jesus ✥ Maria Bernard</p>

<p>(It is well known that St. Bernard was the founder of the Cistercian Order.)
Then, in red (I complete the abbreviated words):&mdash;</p>

<p>'Graduale ad usum Cisterciensis ordinis: secundum capituli generalis
venerabilium patrum ejusdem ordinis diffinitionem in sequenti paginas
declarata: noviter per quendam Clarevallensem monachum ad debitam
formam utiliter redactum. Et Johannis Lecoq impressoris Trecis commorantis
solertia diligenter impressum. Anno Domini Millesimo quingentesimo
vicesimo primo.' (Here Lecoq's large mark: Silvestre, no. 877.)
'Cum privilegio.'</p>

<p>The volume is made up of 2 preliminary leaves, for the title, etc., and
252 pages of text, divided as follows: First part, without pagination, of 18
signatures (<em>a</em> to <em>s</em>) of 4 sheets each, except the last, which has only 2,&mdash;in
all, 140 leaves. Second part, folios 1 to 112, having 14 signatures (A to O)
of 4 sheets&mdash;in all, 112 leaves.</p>

<p>The paper is very strong and fine. It is one of the earliest books printed
with music in France, and it reflects great credit on the presses of Troyes,
and especially upon Jean Lecoq, first of the name. Names of places and
persons are consistently printed with capitals. The work is illustrated with
a few engravings; but its most remarkable feature is the ornamental initials
and uncial letters with which it is embellished.</p>

<p>At the end, by way of colophon, are these words:&mdash;</p>

<p>'Explicit Graduale secundum usum ordinis Cisterciensis, Trecis impressum</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>

vigesimo primo Die sexta mensis Martii. Laus Deo.'</p>

<p>Here Lecoq's mark with the Lorraine cross in white.</p>

<p>This volume came from the ancient monastery of Oliva, near Dantzig.</p>


<p class="p6">1522</p>

<p><span class="smcapa">I.</span> We may place under this date two other frontispieces signed with the
Lorraine cross. The first is a large engraving divided into four compartments,
and representing armies in battle array, with cannon. The two
upper compartments are connected by the shield of France, surmounted
by a crown and encircled by the order of Saint-Michel, from which
branches of rose-bushes depend on either side. In each compartment there
is a cartouche. Tory's mark is at the foot of the lower left-hand compartment,
in which the banner of France is seen waving. This engraving
appears in the 'Rozier historial de France,' a folio printed in gothic type, at
Paris, for François Regnault, February 10, 1522, before Easter; that is to
say, 1523 new style. In the cartouches the following words are printed in
red, in gothic type: 'Bataille ronde,' 'Bataille de pointe,' 'Bataille de feu,'
'Bataille de fourche.'<a name="FNanchor_325_325" id="FNanchor_325_325"></a><a href="#Footnote_325_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a> It appears in another edition of the same book,
printed in 1528 for the same bookseller; also, in a translation of Cæsar's
'Commentaries,' printed by Pierre Vidoue, in 1531, for the booksellers Poncet
Le Preux and Galiot du Pré. This translation is a folio volume divided
into two parts, the first translated by Étienne Delaigue, called Beauvoys,
the second by Robert Gaguin. The plate in question is at the end of the
first part, folio 95 verso. The whole book is printed in black, both text and
engraving. I am indebted for my knowledge of the engraving to M. Robert-Dumesnil
<i>fils</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcapa">II.</span> The second engraving, in the form of a border (folio size), representing
a number of grotesque and licentious subjects, appears in an edition
of the 'Histoire du saint Graal,' published by Philippe le Noir, sworn
bookseller and binder to the University of Paris, on October 24, 1523. The
bookseller's initials are in the compartment at the top of the border.<a name="FNanchor_326_326" id="FNanchor_326_326"></a><a href="#Footnote_326_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a></p>

<p>In this book, as well as in those last described, there are other engravings;
but they are not the work of Tory, to whom only the important
pieces were assigned. These other engravings had, doubtless, appeared elsewhere.</p>

<p>As for the engraving executed by Tory (which reappears in many other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
works printed by Philippe le Noir), it is a copy of a plate engraved by Urs
Graf, dated 1519, and used by Pierre Vidoue, printer at Paris,<a name="FNanchor_327_327" id="FNanchor_327_327"></a><a href="#Footnote_327_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a> particularly
in a Virgil of 1529, folio, which is now in the Bibliothèque Mazarine. The
four principal subjects of this engraving, placed at the four corners of the
border, represent: (1) Men lighting torches at a woman's posterior; (2) A
woman carrying off a man in a basket<a name="FNanchor_328_328" id="FNanchor_328_328"></a><a href="#Footnote_328_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a>; (3) The death of Pyramus and Thisbe;
(4) The judgement of Paris.</p>


<p class="p6">1523</p>

<p>While working for others, Tory busied himself with a long series of
engravings intended for books of Hours to be published by himself.<a name="FNanchor_329_329" id="FNanchor_329_329"></a><a href="#Footnote_329_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a></p>

<p>'It is upon turning over these plates,' says M. Renouvier,<a name="FNanchor_330_330" id="FNanchor_330_330"></a><a href="#Footnote_330_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a> 'that one appreciates
to the full his style&mdash;rich, diversified and immeasurably clever
in ornamentation, distorted out of proportion, diabolic in the drawing of
faces, descending too often to downright awkwardness in the carriage of
the head and to a habit of bellying out draperies; and, finally, overweighted
by a sort of heaviness in the forms. The artist's greatest facility is shown
in the arrangement of his figures, and in the decoration of his porticoes.
Whatever he may say, it would seem that what he studied at Rome with
the best results were the baths of Titus and the arabesques of Giovanni da
Udino.'</p>


<p class="p6">1524-1525</p>

<p>We have seen that Tory had been in the habit for some time of signing
his engravings with a double cross; but this had not yet become an
invariable signature. For instance, about 1524 he often used a monogram
in which his name and surname&mdash;or, to use the terms of the present
day his Christian name [<em>prénom</em>] and his family name [<em>nom de famille</em>]&mdash;both
appear. It consists of a capital G, enclosing a smaller S, with the <img src="images/i_b_179.png" class="figright60" alt="" />
double cross above. This means, in my opinion, that Tory was the
<em>engraver</em> only ('Godofredus Torinus sculpsit'), in distinction from the
cross alone, which means that Tory both drew and engraved the pieces on
which it appears. In fact, we find in most of those signed with the monogram
a roughness of aspect which is not characteristic of Tory's usual style.</p>

<p>However that may be, here is a list of the pieces known to me on which
this monogram appears.</p>

<p>Quarto of 14 leaves, in gothic type, printed by Philippe Le Noir, 'sworn
binder to the University of Paris,' with a privilege from the court of the
Parliament of Paris, dated December 21, 1524. This is a satirical production,
in verse, attributed to Pierre Gringoire, otherwise called Vaudemont,
at the head of which appears the figure, or effigy, of the 'heretic,' signed
with the monogram in question. The description of the effigy is as follows:</p>

<p>A quarto, in gothic type, undated, but containing a table of Easter-Days
beginning with 1524, and a privilege dated October 10, 1525.</p>

<p>This book, which was published by the bookseller Jean Petit, contains
13 large engravings, a list of which follows:&mdash;</p>

<ul class="index">
<li>1. The Annunciation.</li>
<li>2. Adam and Eve.</li>
<li>3. The Cross.</li>
<li>4. The Holy Ghost.</li>
<li>5. The Descent of the Holy Ghost upon the Apostles.</li>
<li>6. David praying for Zion, threatened with the divine thunderbolts.</li>
<li>7. The Virgin and the Child Jesus.</li>
<li>8. A Family at Table (Pentecost?).</li>
<li>9. Eight Naked Children Praying; the Holy Trinity in the Heavens.</li>
<li>10. The Manna.</li>
<li>11. David's Penance.</li>
<li>12. The Triumph of Death.</li>
<li>13. Jesus receiving the Crown of Thorns and the Reed.</li>
</ul>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>

<p>Only the last of these bears the monogram that I have described<a name="FNanchor_332_332" id="FNanchor_332_332"></a><a href="#Footnote_332_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a>;
but the other engravings, being in the same style, should all be attributed
to Tory. We might perhaps also attribute to him the six analogous engravings
which appear in the same author's 'Chants royaux' (printed at
the same time and usually bound with the Hours), but not one of which
is signed. They represent:&mdash;</p>

<ul class="index">
<li>1. The Synagogue: Jesus in the background, entering a pillar.</li>
<li>2. The Prodigal Son: Jesus in the background, curing a woman.</li>
<li>3. Hunters: Jesus in the background, curing one possessed of devils.</li>
<li>4. The Miracle of the Loaves and Fishes.</li>
<li>5. Entrance of Jesus into Jerusalem.</li>
<li>6. The Crowning with Thorns.</li>
</ul>


<p>These two books have been reprinted several times. I know of four
quarto editions of the Hours.<a name="FNanchor_333_333" id="FNanchor_333_333"></a><a href="#Footnote_333_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a> The first is the one I have just described.
It contains some other engravings, in an entirely different style from Tory's,
which appear also in other books of Hours of older date. The second has
a table of Easter-Days beginning with 1528, and a privilege dated November
15, 1527. In other respects it is similar to the earlier one. The third has
a table of Easter-Days beginning with 1534. It is like the last except in
one point: in place of the final engraving there is a different one, signed
in the same way, representing Job at prayer before his burning house,
and his neighbours reviling him. This engraving proves that Tory must
have engraved a longer series from which the printer took this one at
random, being unable at the moment to find the one that he required. The
fourth has a calendar beginning with 1540. It is like the second, except for
the privilege, which is dated November, 1525, doubtless by mistake. These
four editions are all in the Bibliothèque de l'Arsenal.</p>

<p>Small folio, in gothic type, without date of printing, but with a privilege
dated January 12, 1526 (1527 new style), issued by Jean de la Barre,
'garde de la prévôté' of Paris. The battle took place in 1525.</p>

<p>Volcyr's work contains seven engravings, but only the last two, at the
beginning of the last two books, are signed. We may, however, I think,
attribute to Tory the one at the head of the first book also. A description
of these engravings follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. Frontispiece representing Faith: a helmeted woman trampling upon
the dragon.</p>

<p>2. The author, seated, writing his book.</p>

<p>3. A large plate representing a warrior (the Duke of Calabria?) amidst
his men, waving his sword.</p>

<p>4. A bishop praying.</p>

<p>5. The author offering his book to the prince. A fine plate on which are
several scattered letters, the meaning of which I am unable to conceive.</p>

<p>6. A large plate representing the attack on the town of Saverne. At the
top is the word 'Saberna.'</p>

<p>7. A large plate representing the vision of the Passion. Jesus at prayer,
a halo about his head; facing him, angels presenting the Cross; behind
him, other angels bearing the post to which he was bound; all about him,
the instruments of his torture. This plate is altogether in the manner of
those in the following work.</p>

<p>Twelve large plates, folio, owned by the Bibliothèque Nationale. Each
of them was formerly accompanied by a number and by a quatrain in
French explaining the subject; unfortunately these have been removed
from most of the plates,<a name="FNanchor_334_334" id="FNanchor_334_334"></a><a href="#Footnote_334_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a> and it is impossible for me to-day to place them
with full assurance in the order in which they belong. However, that
given below seems to me most natural. The three which retain their numbers
are marked by an asterisk.</p>

<ul class="index">
<li>1. The Nemean Lion.</li>
<li>2. The Lernean Hydra.</li>
<li>*3. Cerberus.</li>
<li>4. Antæus.</li>

<li>6. Hippodamia.</li>
<li>7. Geryon.</li>
<li>8. The Pillars of Hercules.</li>
<li>*9.The Cretan Bull.</li>

<li>12. Hercules at the Stake.</li>
</ul>

<p>All of these engravings are signed: <img src="images/i_b_183.png" width="42" height="80" alt="" /></p>

<p>We give here, as specimens, three of the quatrains accompanying the
engravings; they are the only ones preserved at the Bibliothèque Nationale.
They may very well be the work of Gringoire, like the verses of the
'Blazon des Hérétiques,' of the same date.</p>

<p>The orthography of these verses proves that they were printed in the
seventeenth century<a name="FNanchor_336_336" id="FNanchor_336_336"></a><a href="#Footnote_336_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a>; but the very appearance of the verses, and the condition
of the plates, which are already worm-eaten, are sufficient to justify
one in assigning to the latter a very much earlier date than to the former.
So that I can do no better than to refer them to the year 1525, when we
find Tory using the same monogram.</p>

<p>Tory seems to have attempted in these plates to imitate Mantegna,
whose work he may have studied in Italy; but he had the good sense to
abandon this manner, which was not his own; or perhaps we should say
that he did no more than follow designs which were supplied to him.</p>

<p>This is what M. Renouvier has to say on this subject:&mdash;</p>

<p>'The plates signed with a G surmounted by the Lorraine cross are
of more importance. The Labours of Hercules, in twelve plates, are the
work of no commonplace artist. The drawing assumes a masterly, even a
rough, character, seeking effects in the play of muscles and of facial expression
in imitation of Mantegna and Albrecht Dürer; the cutting follows
up the effect of the burin. Bartsch mentioned them among the old
German masters, and the monogrammatists wavered between Jean Schoorel,
Georges Scharfenberg, Giuseppe Scolari, etc.; their French origin was
not suspected until some proofs were found on which the engravings
were accompanied by French quatrains. Then, when the same mark was
found on a plate used as a frontispiece to Pierre Gringoire's "Blazon des
Hérétiques" (1524), and on several vignettes in the Hours <em>rendered into
verse</em>, by the same poet, it was attempted to make a wood-engraver of
Gringoire, who was a Lorrainer, herald-at-arms to Duc René II, and likely
enough to display the cross of Lorraine over his initial. This much is certain:
that the mark consisting of a G with the cross of Lorraine is found
also on the plates of a Lorraine book&mdash;"Duc Anthoine's Victory over the
Lutherans"&mdash;published by his secretary Volcyr, who paid the expenses
of the publication, "being unable to find any bookseller who was willing
to undertake it, as well because of the portraits and cuts of the illustrations
as of the printing hereof," and caused it to be issued, not in Lorraine,
but in Paris, by Galliot Dupré, in 1526. It is to be noticed that this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
bookseller's mark, which represents a galliot, also has a Lorraine cross surmounting
his cipher. Now, the attribution of these plates to Geofroy
Tory is based upon some very ingenious comparisons of marks; the style
of the engravings places no insurmountable obstacle in the way of such
attribution, but it must be admitted that the engraver was led very far
astray from his earlier works by his imitation of the German manner. It
is possible, because French engraving, at the beginning of the sixteenth
century, was pulled in four directions at once, so to speak, by national
habit, by Flemish taste, by German mania, and by Italian charm. M. Bernard
would give the fullest sanction to this second attribution if he could
find any evidence of a journey of Tory's to Alsace or Lorraine of a later
date than his journey to Italy; the importation of woodcuts from those
provinces, then a common occurrence, would indeed suffice, so far as the
common herd of our engravers is concerned, to explain this alteration in
their manner. I will mention in a moment an example, also out of Lorraine,
which must certainly have been known to Tory. Whatever the fact
may be, the Labours of Hercules deserve an honourable place among the
first attempts on a large scale of French engraving, beside the plates of
Jean Duvet. The British Museum, like our Cabinet des Estampes, has acquired
a set of them. Two of the plates in the latter set have the quatrains
which are lacking in the corresponding ones in the Paris set; these are, the
fifth: "The sly Archelaus 'gainst Hercules doth contend"; and the seventh:
"The mighty Geryon, despicable tyrant," etc.'</p>


<p class="p6">1526</p>

<p><span class="smcapa">I.</span> I have said that the floriated letters of Simon de Colines and Robert
Estienne were engraved by Geofroy Tory. I cannot furnish material proof
of the fact with regard to those of Colines; but I am about to produce
incontestable evidence with regard to Estienne's. A letter in one of his
alphabets is signed with the Lorraine cross, and that letter is the G, the
initial of Tory's own name, or, as we say to-day, his first name (<em>prénom</em>). It
is as if he had written 'Geofroy Tory' in full. But in this case, in opposition
to what we find in the preceding engravings, the cross, instead of
being above the G, is below it, and hidden as much as possible in order
not to injure the design of the 'antique letter.' This circumstance proves
not only that Tory was the engraver of Robert Estienne's floriated letters,
but also that the double cross was that artist's mark.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span></p>

<p>Is it not, in truth, a striking fact that Tory chose the letter G to place
his mark upon? He was not withheld by the consideration that that letter,
not being in very common use, especially at the beginning of words,
appeared rather infrequently in books.<a name="FNanchor_337_337" id="FNanchor_337_337"></a><a href="#Footnote_337_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a> As always, logic prevailed with
him over every other consideration. Let us see how far it carried him.</p>

<p>Later, he engraved a Greek alphabet, in the same style, for Robert
Estienne; as he could not put his mark on the <em>gamma</em>, which bears no
resemblance to the G, he put it on no letter, but on one of the friezes
executed to accompany those beautiful floriated letters.<a name="FNanchor_338_338" id="FNanchor_338_338"></a><a href="#Footnote_338_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a> See the frieze
in question at the beginning of the second volume of the Works of
Eusebius, three volumes, folio, 1544.<a name="FNanchor_339_339" id="FNanchor_339_339"></a><a href="#Footnote_339_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcapa">II.</span> Besides these two alphabets of capital letters, Tory engraved for
Robert Estienne about the same time, six different marks for his typographical
sign, the 'Olive-Tree,' of which a description will be found
later on, in section 3.</p>

<p><span class="smcapa">III.</span> Tory also engraved, about the same time, for Simon de Colines,
a border in the criblé style, at the foot of which is a sun which certain
centaurs, incited thereto by women, are trying to seize. (Silvestre, no.
523). This border is probably of 1526, when Colines turned over to
Robert Estienne his father's establishment and set up for himself at the
'Soleil d'Or,' opposite the Collège de Beauvais. It appears, to my knowledge,
in two octavo volumes of 1529: 'Compendium Grammaticæ
græcæ Jacobi Ceporini,' and 'Liber de opificio Dei.'</p>


<p class="p6">1526-1528</p>

<p>This whole period was, in all probability, absorbed by the labour of engraving
and editing 'Champ fleury.' For one of the first engravings in
that book is dated 1526, and it was finished early in 1529. Although the
majority of these engravings are not signed, they must all belong to Tory,
at all events so far as the designs are concerned.<a name="FNanchor_340_340" id="FNanchor_340_340"></a><a href="#Footnote_340_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a> I cannot attempt to enumerate
them all here, for there are more than five hundred, counting as
one each of the letters in the various alphabets; but I propose to mention
the more important ones. For historical information concerning the book,
I refer the reader back to what I have said thereon in the first and second
parts of this volume.</p>

<p>Folio 3 verso: the Gallic Hercules. This engraving, dated 1526, and signed
with the Lorraine cross, represents Hercules holding his club in one hand
and a bow in the other. He is followed by divers persons of all conditions,
fastened by the ear to a chain that issues from the hero's mouth. This is
an allusion to the power of eloquence over the French. The strength of
the Gallic Hercules lies not in his arms but in his mouth.<a name="FNanchor_345_345" id="FNanchor_345_345"></a><a href="#Footnote_345_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a></p>

<p>Folio 9 verso: cut of the <em>lisflambe</em>, a species of lily; it is the swamp iris,
called to-day the <em>iris flambe</em>.</p>

<p>Here the first book ends.</p>

<p>The second contains thirty-seven geometrical figures, which it would
be no less difficult than unprofitable to describe. They are, for the most
part, representations of different letters. At the end of this book is the 'Triumph
of Apollo and the Muses,' 'to show that they who have knowledge
of goodly letters have the advantage over the ignorant.' This engraving,
which is in two parts,<a name="FNanchor_346_346" id="FNanchor_346_346"></a><a href="#Footnote_346_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a> both signed with the Lorraine cross (folios 29 verso
and 30 recto), represents Apollo in a chariot, escorted by the Muses, Liberal
Arts, etc., and followed by Bacchus, Ceres and Venus as prisoners.<a name="FNanchor_347_347" id="FNanchor_347_347"></a><a href="#Footnote_347_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a></p>

<p>On the very last page (folio 30 recto) is an engraving of the <em>lisflambe</em>
surmounted by an A made up of three I's.<a name="FNanchor_348_348" id="FNanchor_348_348"></a><a href="#Footnote_348_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a></p>

<p>The third book has, in the first place, twenty-eight engravings of Roman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
letters. The twenty-ninth represents a gothic S (folio 42 verso). The
thirtieth is a representation of the Pot Cassé, signed with the Lorraine cross
(folio 43 verso).<a name="FNanchor_349_349" id="FNanchor_349_349"></a><a href="#Footnote_349_349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a></p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p>Next come thirty-eight other cuts of letters, and two curious drawings
of the letter Y (folio 63 recto and verso).<a name="FNanchor_350_350" id="FNanchor_350_350"></a><a href="#Footnote_350_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a> Then two ordinary copies of the
letter Z, and an allegory based on the shape of that letter (folio 65).<a name="FNanchor_351_351" id="FNanchor_351_351"></a><a href="#Footnote_351_351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a></p>

<p>Folios 68 verso and
69 recto: a Hebrew
alphabet of forty letters
or symbols.</p>

twenty-three letters,
with three punctuation
marks, and the
Greek abbreviation
of the name of Jesus.</p>

<p>Folio 74 recto: the

Tory's mottoes: 'Menti bonæ Deus occurrit'; 'Sic ut, vel ut'; 'Omnis

it seems to be the same cut that appears on folio 43 verso, with the
cross removed.</p>

<p>In 1528 Pierre Vidoue printed, at the expense of Gilles de Gourmont,
nine comedies of Aristophanes, in Greek, which were published separately,
in quarto form, under the editorship of Jean Cheradam.<a name="FNanchor_358_358" id="FNanchor_358_358"></a><a href="#Footnote_358_358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a> All of these have
a frontispiece engraved by Tory, of which a description follows. At the
foot, under the words 'Egidivs Gormontivs' in large letters, is a shield
with the Gourmont arms (three roses in chief and a crescent in point),
supported by two winged stags with ducal coronets about their necks, the
crest being a helmet above which is a St. Michael holding a naked sword.<a name="FNanchor_359_359" id="FNanchor_359_359"></a><a href="#Footnote_359_359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a>
At the left, a Greek inscription; at the right, an inscription in Hebrew.
The two uprights represent the wise men offering their gifts to the Child
Jesus lying on his mother's knees. At the top is a shield with three crowns
in chief (this was the sign of Gilles de Gourmont, as may be seen on the
title-page of 'Champ fleury'), and tears in the field. This shield has for
supporters, on the right a lion, on the left a griffin, and for crest a helmet
surmounted by a fan-shaped ornament. On either side is an angel with
wings holding a shield; that on the left enclosing an E, that on the right<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
a G, the initials of Gilles de Gourmont's name in Latin (Egidius Gourmontius).
The Lorraine cross is at the foot of the border, on the left.<a name="FNanchor_360_360" id="FNanchor_360_360"></a><a href="#Footnote_360_360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a></p>

<p>Small octavo, Paris, 1528, with engravings signed with the Lorraine
cross.<a name="FNanchor_361_361" id="FNanchor_361_361"></a><a href="#Footnote_361_361" class="fnanchor">[361]</a> Printed in red and black, in gothic type. There are 31 signatures of
8 leaves,&mdash;<em>a</em> to <em>z</em>, and A to G (signatures <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> have only four leaves
each). In all there are 232 numbered leaves, plus 4 leaves of index not
numbered.</p>

<p>The volume begins with the title-page, followed by a calendar, the
whole occupying 13 leaves, after which comes the text. It contains 54 engraved
plates, 12 of which are in the calendar, and a large number of
initial letters representing sacred subjects. Beneath each plate is a quatrain
in English.</p>

<p>The 12 plates in the calendar represent allegorical subjects. They are
enclosed in oval borders, and are 71 millimetres by 55. Consequently they
are all out of proportion to the size of the book, which is 84 millimetres
by 48. It is evident therefore that they were not made for it. At the foot
of each, in the border, is the name of the month. The engraving for the
month of February represents a school; that for March, a hunt; that for
April, a gentleman and lady, walking in the country, arm in arm; that for
July, a domestic interior. The last is the only one of these engravings
that I have seen, and that only in a copy. The Lorraine cross may be
seen at the foot.</p>

<p>Here follows a list of the other engravings of this priceless volume, of
which only a single copy is known to exist. It is to be observed that the
pages on which they appear are not numbered, as the cuts occupy the whole
space.</p>

<p>Quarto, Paris, Josse Bade, 1529.</p>

<p>The Bibliothèque Mazarine has two copies of this priceless volume,
one on paper, the other on vellum, which differ slightly in respect to the
title-page. The one on vellum reads: 'Encomium Joannis Bertaudi Petragorici
Turrisalbæ in ducatu Engolismensi alumni, de cultu trium Mariarum
adversus Lutheranos, cum missa solemniore et officio canonico
earundem, auspiciis augustissimæ principis Joannæ, Aurelianensis, Gyveriensium
dominæ ac comitis de Barcq.' This is followed by a large plate
signed with the Lorraine cross, and representing the three Maries, etc.
There is no publisher's name; nothing but Josse Bade's mark at the end of
the book.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span></p>

<p>The title-page of the copy on paper reads: 'Encomium trium Mariarum
cum earumdem cultus defensione adversus Lutheranos, solemnique
missa et officio canonico, in quibus omnibus desideres nihil, emissum opera
et industria Joannis Bertaudi Petragorici, utriusque juris licentiati, Turrisque
Albæ in ducatu Engolismensi alumni, auspiciis augustissimæ principis
Joannæ Aurelianensis, Gyveriensium dominæ ac comitis de Barcq.'
Then follows Josse Bade's mark: 'Prelum Ascensianum,' taking the place
of the engraving of the three Maries. And below, 'Venundatur Jodoco
Badio et Galeoto a Pratis.'</p>

<p>This difference is explained by the fact that the copies on vellum were
not intended for sale, so that no bookseller's name was placed on them,
and, furthermore, they were embellished with the cut of the three Maries.</p>

<p>This volume contains three short productions by Jean Bertaud, all directed
to the same end&mdash;the defence of the worship of the three Maries.</p>

<p>They are entitled:</p>

<p>(1) Encomium trium Mariarum. (2) Officium trium filiarum beatæ
Annæ. (3) De cognatione sacerrimi Joannis Baptistæ.</p>

<p>There are some twenty engravings, but none of them are signed except
that of the three Maries. And, as Josse Bade was an old printer, who
had no known relations with Tory, we may assume that these engravings
are not by our artist. At most, we may attribute to him the shield of Orléans,
at page 4 of the first work.</p>

<p>Large folio, with an engraved frontispiece having the Lorraine cross

<p>The frontispiece represents several different subjects. At the top is
Jesus healing the leper; at the foot, doctors dissecting a dead body and
lecturing to a numerous audience; at the sides, full-length portraits of
the most celebrated physicians of antiquity; in the centre of the plate is
a scroll bearing the Latin title transcribed above. This frontispiece was,
doubtless, used with others of the works of Galen.</p>

<p>Simon de Colines also published, in 1536, an edition of the works of
Galen, under the supervision of the same editor (folio of 172 pages), and
embellished with five beautiful floriated letters engraved by Tory. In it
we find also, at the head of the epistle to the reader, an ornamental S surmounted

<p>Inasmuch as Tory died in 1533, it will, perhaps, seem that I ought to
stop here in this enumeration. But as many engravings executed by his
own hand were not printed until later, and, moreover, as those signed with
the Lorraine cross alone came from his establishment, which was managed
by his wife after his death, I have thought best to pursue my investigations
concerning the engravings with the Lorraine cross to the end.</p>

<p>Folio, Paris, Thielman Kerver's widow, 1534. The privilege is dated
1534. (Bibliothèque S.-Geneviève, and Bibliothèque Mazarine.)</p>

<p>The Latin title which I have transcribed is engraved in great gothic
letters, arranged in the shape of a cul-de-lampe, and terminated by a small
black heart-shaped ornament (not unlike those used by Simon de Colines),
in which is the Lorraine cross. This circumstance leads me to believe that
Tory engraved this title-page in gothic letters; a most interesting fact if
true, for they are probably the only letters in that style that he ever engraved,
after those on folios 42 verso, 74, etc. of 'Champ fleury'; and it is
all the more strange because the rest of the book is printed in roman type.
It may be that there was another edition in gothic type.</p>

<p>However, this volume contains many other engravings signed with the
Lorraine cross, and others which, although unsigned, seem to be Tory's.</p>

<p>Folio 1, following the title, a large T, adorned with fleurs-de-lis, on a
background strewn with the same flowers.</p>

<p>Folio 5 verso, a large ornamental P, representing the Eternal Father.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>

<p>'His chef-d'œuvre,' says M. Renouvier,<a name="FNanchor_368_368" id="FNanchor_368_368"></a><a href="#Footnote_368_368" class="fnanchor">[368]</a> 'is, perhaps, the frontispiece
of Macault's "Diodorus," in which we see François I seated in a chair with
a back carved with fleurs-de-lis, at table with his children, his monkey, his
greyhound, and his courtiers, while Macault reads his book to him. This
engraving, the authorship of which is unquestionable, does not bear the
Lorraine cross; the master published without that mark many another
work which M. Bernard, in his scrupulous exactitude, has chosen not to
mention. As some compensation for the works which I have denied to
Tory, I may be allowed the pleasure of mentioning here one which M.
Bernard has not attributed to him: "Les Fables d'Esopes mises en rithme
françois," by Gilles Corrozet (Paris, Denys Janot, 1542). As the copy that
I saw is not complete, it may be that the Lorraine cross might have been
found somewhere in the book; but, in any event, that would not change
the conviction based upon examination of the plates. The small engravings,
with the first four lines of the fables, are set in borders decorated with
pilasters and pediments in the master's style, and illustrated at the base
with tiny drawings of amorous subjects, treated with his somewhat heavy-handed
delicacy.</p>

<p>'There came from Tory's establishment, in the later years, many engravings
of blended types which can be attributed to none but pupils,
or even apprentices; analysis will always be impossible; when we have
cast a light upon the head of a school, we must leave the tail to languish
in the shadow. I will mention here, however, one pupil of Geofroy Tory,
whom M. Bernard does not mention, namely, François Gryphe, brother
of Sébastien Gryphe of Lyon. He engraved and printed, in 1539, a New
Testament which, as very rarely happens, mentions the engraver of the
plates on the title-page as well as in the privileges from the King and the
Parliament which stand at the beginning and end of the book respectively.
"Novum testamentum illustratum insignium rerum simulacris, cum ad
veritatem historiæ, tum ad venustatem, singulari artificio expressis." (Here
the mark of the griffin.) "Excudebat Fran. Gryphius, <span class="smcapa">AN. MDXXXIX</span>." And

<p>Quarto, Robert Estienne, 1536.</p>

<p>Charles Estienne, brother of the printer, who seems to have been the
editor of this book, informs us, in a brief preface, that the drawings scattered
through it were taken by him from ancient monuments, and especially
from marbles still extant at Rome. Several of the plates bear the
Lorraine cross, Robert Estienne's mark, on the title-page; also the engraving
on page 19 of 'De re navali' (repeated on page 168), and those on
pages 4, 44 and 64 of 'De re vestiaria'. All the other engravings, although
not signed, probably came from Tory's workshop. This book was reprinted
by Robert Estienne, in 1549, in the same form. Here is a summarized
list of the engravings contained in it: In the first part, 'De re
navali,' are some twenty representations of antique vessels, biremes, triremes,
etc., of which one is signed; in the second part, 'De re vestiaria,'
three are signed: (1) a woman; (2) a man; (3) a soldier; in the third part,
'De vasculis,' are eight or ten representations of vases, etc., not signed.</p>

<p>All these engravings were reproduced on copper in a reprint of Baïf's
work, published in Grævius's great collection called the 'Treasure of Antiquities,'<a name="FNanchor_371_371" id="FNanchor_371_371"></a><a href="#Footnote_371_371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a>
and, strangely enough, the artist has left the Lorraine cross on
the first.<a name="FNanchor_372_372" id="FNanchor_372_372"></a><a href="#Footnote_372_372" class="fnanchor">[372]</a> This mark appears again in column 1100 of the same volume, in
an analogous work by another author. The same engraving was reëngraved
on copper, with the cross, for the edition of Grævius's 'Thesaurus,'
published at Venice in 1732, after the edition of Utrecht. This later edition
was like the earlier one, and the engraving in question appears in
the same volume and same column. So that we have an engraving on
copper, with the Lorraine cross, executed in the eighteenth century!</p>

<img src="images/i_b_210.jpg" width="362" height="560" alt="" />
</div>

<p>All the pages are enclosed in borders, but
the latter are of two sorts:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. Eight complete borders, that is to say,
thirty-two compartments, in simple line-engraving
as in the Hours of 1524-1525. A
single one of these eight is signed; but they
are all by the same artist. They bear the dates
of 1536, 1537, 1539, in little scrolls of the
sort to which Tory was so much addicted.
These dates preclude our attributing these
engravings to himself, but they evidently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
came from his establishment which was then
conducted by his widow. One of these borders
appears in a book published in 1542:
'Rodolphi Agricolæ ... de inventione dialectica,
libri III,' etc. 4to, Paris, Simon de
Colines.</p>

<p>2. There are also eight complete borders,
or thirty-two compartments, engraved in
black in an entirely different style, alternating
with those engraved in line. [Four of them
are reproduced in this volume, on the pages
bearing the Author's Preface.] They are in
niello, are neither signed nor dated, and I
doubt whether they came from Tory's workshop,
although we shall see that he engraved
some similar ones for Jean de Tournes. In any
event their inclusion in this book, side by side
with the borders and drawings engraved in
line, seems to me in wretched taste which
would have disgusted our artist.</p>

<p>We find also in this book some beautiful
ornamental letters in the criblé style, which
may be Tory's.</p>

Claude Chaudière, successors to Simon de Colines.</p>

<p>As in the quarto Hours of the same date the borders of the text pages
are arabesques of two styles, some in line and the others in black; and the
drawings, to the number of 13, are set in a special border. Some of these
borders bear the date 1537, and one of them has the name Simon de Colines
in full, which proves that the engravings were executed for him. A list of
the drawings follows; only one of them is signed, but all seem to be the work
of Tory.</p>

one of which, dated 1538, represents God the Father seated on his throne, his
head surrounded by a halo; he is dressed like the Pope; over his head, a triangular
pediment. The other, not dated, represents Christ on the Cross;
the Blessed Virgin and St. John are standing at his sides, and this inscription
is printed in a semicircle over the cross: 'Absit michi gloriari nisi in
crvce D[omi]ni n[ost]ri Jesvs Christi.'</p>

<p>These two subjects, which are often found in collections, sometimes on
paper and sometimes on vellum, sometimes black and sometimes coloured
(the mark and the date very often disappear under the colours<a name="FNanchor_374_374" id="FNanchor_374_374"></a><a href="#Footnote_374_374" class="fnanchor">[374]</a>), were first
printed, so far as my knowledge goes, in the Missal of Paris, published in
1539 by Thielman Kerver's widow. There follows a description of this
priceless volume, of which I know but one copy in Paris.<a name="FNanchor_375_375" id="FNanchor_375_375"></a><a href="#Footnote_375_375" class="fnanchor">[375]</a> It is entitled:
'Missale ad usum Ecclesiæ Parisiensis, noviter impressum, et emendatum
per deputatos a reverendissimo domino Johanne de Bellayo, Parisiensi episcopo,'
etc. Then comes Thielman Kerver's usual mark, and below: 'Prostat

<p>This work makes a large folio volume, printed in red and black, in gothic
type, with a large number of unsigned engravings in the text. These engravings
are of three sorts,&mdash;(1) floriated letters on a black ground; (2)
small drawings of the same size, but of a very graceful renaissance type; (3)
drawings of octavo size, which were commonly used by Thielman Kerver's
widow in the books of Hours published by her, and of which I have
already had occasion to speak.<a name="FNanchor_376_376" id="FNanchor_376_376"></a><a href="#Footnote_376_376" class="fnanchor">[376]</a></p>

<p>The two large drawings signed with the Lorraine cross face each other
in signature V, in the second part of the book, where the pagination is discontinued.
They have been reprinted several times in other editions of the
same book. I will mention particularly the edition, undated, published in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
the name of Guillaume Merlin, bookseller, a copy of which is in the Bibliothèque
Mazarine<a name="FNanchor_377_377" id="FNanchor_377_377"></a><a href="#Footnote_377_377" class="fnanchor">[377]</a>; that of 1543, at the Bibliothèque Sainte-Geneviève;
that of 1559 (all published by Iolande Bonhomme or her son Jacques Kerver);
and lastly a Missal of Cluny, of which I shall speak later.</p>

<p>Although these books are printed on paper, the plates in question are
always printed on vellum in editions of the sixteenth century; but this precaution
was neglected in later centuries.</p>


<p class="p6">1538-1540</p>

<p>Latin Bible in two folio volumes, bearing the dates 1538, 1539, 1540.
Paris, Robert Estienne. The word 'Biblia' appears on the title-page in a
scroll signed with the Lorraine cross, of which I have already had occasion
to speak, under the date of 1532, and which appears in others of
Robert Estienne's books.<a name="FNanchor_378_378" id="FNanchor_378_378"></a><a href="#Footnote_378_378" class="fnanchor">[378]</a> The second title follows: 'Hebræa, chaldæa,
græca et latina nomina ... restituta cum latina interpretatione.' This has led
some bibliographers to assume, erroneously, that the book was a polyglot
affair. It is printed throughout in Latin; there are simply a few Hebrew
words in the dissertation to which the second title in question applies,
and which is printed in the second volume, with a title-page of its own,
dated 1538. The New Testament, also in the second volume, is dated 1539,
not 1540, as M. Renouard mistakenly says.<a name="FNanchor_379_379" id="FNanchor_379_379"></a><a href="#Footnote_379_379" class="fnanchor">[379]</a> The Bible alone, that is to
say, the first volume and the beginning of the second, bears the date 1540.
In each part we find Robert Estienne's large mark, signed with the Lorraine
cross. The first volume contains also eighteen magnificent engravings
representing the Tabernacle of Moses, Solomon's Temple, etc., executed
under the direction of François Vatable, Royal Professor of Hebrew
Literature. The Lorraine cross appears on the large plate of the camp of
the Israelites, on folio 35; but I dare not upon this evidence alone attribute
all the other engravings to Tory.<a name="FNanchor_380_380" id="FNanchor_380_380"></a><a href="#Footnote_380_380" class="fnanchor">[380]</a> In any event the floriated letters used in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>the book are certainly Tory's, for we find the designs mentioned by him in
his 'Champ fleury.' It is a fact worth noting that these letters seem to have
been cast, or, at least, reproduced by stereotyping, for they are often repeated
on the same page, without the slightest change in the design.</p>

<p>The Bibliothèque Nationale has a superb copy of this book on vellum,
with the arms of François I. It was reprinted in the same shape by Robert
Estienne in 1546, and by his son Henri in 1565. In this last edition, printed
at Geneva, we no longer find the two small drawings which appear, with
the frieze, on the title-page of the edition of 1532. (See p. 204, supra.) The
frieze in this later form appears in other books of the Estiennes. I have
seen it in a folio Xenophon printed for Fugger.</p>

and Jean Longis. Folio, with engravings.</p>

<p>I have seen only two of these engravings signed with the Lorraine cross,
but several others seem to have come from the same workshop. The great
majority of them, however, are of another <em>make</em>. The two that are signed
are: (1) Book <span class="smcapa">II</span>, chap. 2, a large plate representing a sort of temple. A man
armed cap-à-pie under a portico. At the right are shields hanging upon
posts; at the left, a man kneeling on the ground, holding a naked sword in
the air with his right hand, and another hand grasping it. This represents
a scene from the 'Île Ferme.' (2) Book <span class="smcapa">VI</span>, chap. 56, a small plate representing
four persons on horseback near a château in front of which stands
an armed man. This cut does not seem to have any connection with the subject,
and may well have been taken from another older work.</p>

<p>This work is embellished with engravings, of which only one is signed
with the Lorraine cross. This one, which is on folio <span class="smcapa">I</span> recto of the Acts of
the Apostles, represents the descent of the Holy Ghost upon the Apostles.

is the date 1537. The same border surrounds the frontispiece of the Mystery
of the Apocalypse, but there it is without the date. This last-named portion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>

<p>This book, printed by Olivier Mallard in 1541, was copied doubtless
from the edition made by Tory about 1531, which I have been unable to
examine. Mallard's edition, of which I have seen a copy on vellum, belonging

plague,' ends thus: 'Excudebat Parisiis Oliverius Mallard, bibliopola regius,
sub signo Vasis Effracti.'...</p>

<p>In this edition there are 16 different borders; each leaf has the same
border on both recto and verso. There are also 16 of the engravings of the
sixteenmo Hours of 1529, those not reproduced being nos. 1, 19 and 21 of
that edition.</p>

<p>The word 'Rom.' printed on the first page of each signature leads me
to believe that Mallard published at the same time, in the same format, an
edition of Hours 'ad usum Parisianum,' but I have found no trace of such
an edition.</p>

<p>After Olivier Mallard's death, which occurred, as I have said heretofore,
in 1542, his typographical outfit seems to have been acquired by
Thielman Kerver II (son of the first Thielman and Iolande Bonhomme,
who lived, as did his father before him, on Rue Saint-Jacques); for he
published in 1550 a book of Hours similar to that printed in 1541 by Mallard.
It contains the same borders and the same drawings, but in a different
arrangement. The borders have been lengthened by means of a most
ungraceful addition to the side-pieces; as for the drawings in two parts,
no pains has been taken to place the parts facing each other, so that their
meaning would be uncertain if we had no other editions of the engravings.
In fine, this book is very imperfect. It consists of twenty-two and a
half signatures, A to Y. The title-page reads thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>H<span class="smcapa">ORÆ IN LAUDEM BEATISSIMÆ</span> V<span class="smcapa">IRGINIS</span> M<span class="smcapa">ARIÆ AD USUM ROMANUM</span>.
(Here the mark of Thielman Kerver, with the Lorraine cross.) 'Parisiis,
apud Thielmannum Kerver, vico sancti Jacobi, sub signo Cratis.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
M.D.L.' The book closes with the curious 'prescription' found in Olivier
Mallard's edition of 1541, which is in these words: 'Approbatissima
medicina contra pestem.&mdash;Recipe quantum potes de amaritudine mentis
contra peccata commissa, cum vera cordis contritione, potius libram quam
unciam. Hæc misceantur cum aqua lacrymarum, et facies vomitum per
puram confessionem. Deinde sumas illud sacratiss. electuarium corporis
Christi, et tutus eris a peste.'</p>

<p>The book is printed in red and black. I have seen a copy on paper at M.
Potier's bookshop. There is an imperfect copy at the Bibliothèque Mazarine,
and a perfect one at Sainte-Geneviève.</p>

<p>About the same time there was published a small duodecimo volume
of four signatures, in French, with the same borders. It begins thus: 'Here
follows the method of receiving the blessed sacrament devoutly.' It is like
the book last-described except that it is printed in only one colour, and that
it is a little longer and wider.<a name="FNanchor_383_383" id="FNanchor_383_383"></a><a href="#Footnote_383_383" class="fnanchor">[383]</a> To lengthen the borders, sections have been
added to them. It is most peculiar that a duodecimo volume should be larger
than an octavo, but the fact is unquestionable: formats were already
beginning to increase in size. Near the end of the book is a little treatise
with this heading: 'Here follows a devout meditation as to the manner
in which thou shouldst ordain and arrange the whole day,' etc. And
after that: 'The life of Madame Sainte-Marguerite, with prayer to be
said for women pregnant and in travail.'</p>

<p>This book is in the Bibliothèque Mazarine, in the same collection as the
last. It contains four small engravings, of which only one seems to me to
belong to Tory: it is the Christ on the Cross, which appears in the quarto
Hours of 1542, now to be described.</p>


<p class="p6">1542</p>

<p><span class="smcapa">I.</span> Hours, according to the Roman use, quarto, in Latin, published by
Olivier Mallard in 1542. This rare volume, of which I know only one copy,
belonging to M. Aerts, of Metz,<a name="FNanchor_384_384" id="FNanchor_384_384"></a><a href="#Footnote_384_384" class="fnanchor">[384]</a> who himself kindly brought it to me at
Paris, is a reproduction of the Hours printed by Tory in 1531; the type,
however, is smaller. It consists of nineteen signatures of two quarto sheets
<em>encartées</em>, signatures A to T. The title-page reads: HORAE <span class="smcapa">IN LAUDEM
BEATISS</span>. V<span class="smcapa">IRGINIS MARIÆ</span> A<span class="smcapa">D USUM</span> R<span class="smcapa">OMANUM</span>. O<span class="smcapa">FFICIUM</span> T<span class="smcapa">RIPLEX</span>.&mdash;Parrhisiis,
apud Oliverium Mallard, impressorem Regium. The rest is as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
in the edition of 1531. On the last page: 'Parrhisiis, ex officina Oliverii
Mallard, Regii impressoris, Ad insigna Vasis Effracti. Anno salu. <span class="smcapa">M. D. XLII</span>. Mense Augusti.' Then come the two lines:&mdash;</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">'Effracti, lector, subeas insignia vasis,</div>
  <div class="i1">gregios flores ut tibi habere queis.'</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The table of Easter-Days, on the verso of the title-page, goes from 1542 to
1571; then comes the calendar, in which the order of the edition of 1531
has been followed in the arrangement of the borders, although the type,
being smaller, would have permitted the more regular arrangement of the
edition of 1524-25.</p>

<p>The book is printed in two colours, except signatures B, C, and D,
which are in black only&mdash;a most unusual state of things. The engravings
are the same as those of the edition of 1531, but the floriated letters are
different. The Passion, which begins on folio B 3 verso, is enriched by the
small Christ on the Cross which we find in the Hours of 1529, but without
the four additional subjects (bees, etc.), which there accompany it.<a name="FNanchor_385_385" id="FNanchor_385_385"></a><a href="#Footnote_385_385" class="fnanchor">[385]</a> It is
probable that some accident happened to the plate, and that only the Christ
was saved. We find also in this volume, at the foot of the border, the
crowned C of Queen Claude of France, who had then been dead about
fifteen years.</p>

<p>The Lorraine cross, which had disappeared from several of the larger
engravings as early as the edition of 1531, appears on almost none of
them in that of 1542. For example, it has been expunged from the Birth
of Jesus and the Circumcision. The only ones which retain it are the Visitation,
the Crucifixion, and the Descent of the Holy Ghost. It remains on
the borders also.</p>

<p>Signature E begins with a leaf the recto of which is blank, while on the
verso is the angel of the Annunciation, as in the edition of 1531. The large
plate, the Triumph of the Virgin Mary, is also included in this edition.</p>

1543, in his Bibliothèque françoise. This much is certain&mdash;that M. Renouvier
owned a copy, with illustrations, dated 1544. It is an octavo, 'for sale
by Charles l'Angelier, in the "grand'salle du Palais."' It contains 112 leaves
(signatures A to O), plus 4 unnumbered leaves. The engravings are of two
sorts: the first represents an emperor on horseback, carrying a battle-axe;
there is no mark, but it is engraved with much delicacy and distinguished
by the little cartouches of which Tory was so fond; this figure is reproduced
several times. The others are busts of emperors, roughly engraved, which
cannot be Tory's. It may be noted that the edition published by Tory in
1530 contains no engravings.</p>

Folio, Simon de Colines, 1545.</p></blockquote>

<p>There are in this book about sixty large anatomical plates. Five are
signed with the Lorraine cross&mdash;folios 149, 150, 151, 154, 155. The last
four bear also the name of Jollat, with the dates 1530, 1531, 1532. Here is
what M. Renouvier has to say on the subject: 'Simon de Colines ... employed
another wood-engraver of some note, Mercure Jollat, to whom Papillon
attributed almost all of our gothic books of Hours. He should be reckoned
only among the engravers of an altogether modernized manner. His
name is written Iollat, the first letter in the zodiacal sign of Mercury, followed
by the dates 1530, 1531, and 1532, and accompanied by the Lorraine
cross, on four plates of Charles Estienne's book on the dissection of the human
body, representing the cadaver in its skin and the cadaver with the skin
removed. The drawing of the figures has been attributed, even by Brulliot,
to Woeiriot; but it is really the work of the surgeon Estienne Rivière, who
is named on the title-page and in the preface as the painter of the bones,
ligaments, and all the anatomical details. His initials, S. R., appear on a
tablet hanging from the branches of a tree in the first plate. The engraving,
which varies considerably, would seem to be the work of different hands,
or, at least, to have come from an establishment which practised diverse
styles and which sometimes put forth work done by apprentices. The workmanship
of the plates with Jollat's mark seemed to me more monotonous&mdash;not
unskilful although less picturesque. I am not now passing upon their
scientific merit, but upon their picturesque interest simply.'<a name="FNanchor_387_387" id="FNanchor_387_387"></a><a href="#Footnote_387_387" class="fnanchor">[387]</a></p>

<p>The inscription of Jollat's name on plates marked with the Lorraine
cross seems, at first glance, quite hard to explain, especially with the general
opinion concerning the former of these artists, based on Papillon's
statements. But as the story of Jollat's work as an engraver still remains
to be told, I think I may safely say that he simply designed the plates that
bear his name in Charles Estienne's book, and that they were engraved by
Tory, or, at least, in his workshop. We have seen, in fact, that Tory was
Simon de Colines' favourite engraver. To be sure, M. Renouvier seems to
be of opinion that all the plates were designed by Estienne Rivière, whence
he concludes that the engraving is by Jollat; but this is a mistaken opinion,
based on a sentence in the preface. Rivière, who was a friend of Charles Estienne,
may have designed the majority of the plates in Charles Estienne's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
book, and yet not have designed all of them. Those signed Jollat evidently
belong to that artist, who seems to have designed a number of them before
the work was placed in Rivière's hands.</p>

<p>I am confirmed in my belief that Jollat was the designer of the plates
in question by the fact that his name is always accompanied by the dates,
and that those dates are not those of the engraving, which I propose to
prove. There are only five plates signed with Jollat's name and with the
Lorraine cross in the Latin edition of Charles Estienne's book, published
by Simon de Colines in 1545. In the following year the same printer issued
a French edition of this work, under the title, 'La Dissection des parties
du corps humain' (folio, 1546), in which we find two additional plates so
marked and dated 1532. Why did not these plates appear in the first edition,
if they were engraved by Jollat?</p>

<p>But here is another fact even more conclusive. In 1575 the bookseller
Jacques Kerver published a volume of engravings without text, entitled
'Les Figures et portraicts des parties du corps humain' (folio), in which we
find not only the seven engravings with the cross, of the edition of 1546,
but three others, also bearing Jollat's mark and the Lorraine cross, and
dated 1533. Evidently these plates appeared in some earlier edition, unknown
to me,<a name="FNanchor_388_388" id="FNanchor_388_388"></a><a href="#Footnote_388_388" class="fnanchor">[388]</a> for it was not Kerver who had them engraved; he simply
made use of the woodcuts of which he had become the owner. But why did
they not appear in the edition of 1546? That is a matter easily explained.</p>

<p>Charles Estienne informs us in the preface to his book that the printing
was well advanced in 1539, but that it was interrupted by a lawsuit.
We give his own words in the French edition of 1546: 'All of which
things were well-nigh finished in the year 1539, and almost so far as the
middle of the third book printed, when, by reason of a suit that was begun,
we were forced (to your great discontent, methinks) to lay aside this
work and to desist from the completion thereof; for so long that in the
mean time it has been possible for many others to invent new ideas touching
this matter, and to make use at their will of many sheets filled with
our writings; for it was not possible for the printer so closely to safeguard
his book, so long suppressed, that some persons curious to learn of novel
things might not take away some sheets, still uncorrected, and send them
into Germany.'</p>

<p>Now let us see what was the cause of this suit. Charles Estienne does<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
not inform us, but it has been disclosed by M. Ambroise Didot, in his
'Essai sur la Gravure.' The famous Vésale had published at Venice, in 1538,
through the printer B. Vitalis, a treatise on anatomy, embellished with
numerous plates, which was copied in several places, and notably in Paris,
despite the privilege granted by the Republic. Later, wishing to issue a
new and improved edition of his book, Vésale applied to Oporin, professor
of Greek, and printer at Basle, to whom he sent his plates, which had been
engraved at Venice by Calcar, a pupil of Titian. In 1543 Oporin finished
printing this new edition, for which the author had, no doubt, obtained
privileges from various sovereigns, especially from the King of France.
This seems to be proved by the suit instituted against Charles Estienne.
That is why the latter could not publish, in his edition of 1545, all the
plates which he had had made, and which appeared only at intervals as the
date of Vésale's privilege was left behind. As we have seen, he gives it to
be understood in his preface that it was he who was robbed in Germany.</p>

<p>As this is a favourable opportunity, I will say a few words concerning
Jacques Kerver's publication, of which I have never seen any mention,<a name="FNanchor_389_389" id="FNanchor_389_389"></a><a href="#Footnote_389_389" class="fnanchor">[389]</a>
but which is of great interest to us. It is a folio volume, containing 61 large
plates besides a considerable number of small ones. There is no other text
than the explanations printed on the plates,<a name="FNanchor_390_390" id="FNanchor_390_390"></a><a href="#Footnote_390_390" class="fnanchor">[390]</a> and a brief note to the reader,
which begins thus: 'Friend reader, seeing that medicine is not at all essential
to preserve the health and to banish all diseases, which often, on slight
occasion, assail us, and that anatomy, or the description of the parts of the
human body, mainly serves us therein, I have determined not to fail to
exhibit them to you here.' We give a description of those plates in the book
which are of interest to us.</p>


<p class="center"><em>Plates which appear only in Kerver's volume.</em></p>

<p>1. The human body in its relation to the signs of the zodiac (folio A 2

<p>10. Man in his skin, rear view (folio 155, 1545; folio 161, 1546; folio B 5
recto, 1575). The same marks, with the date 1531.</p>

<p>Many others of the plates may belong to Tory, but as they are not
marked, I shall not speak of them here.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Something analogous to what I have just described took place with
reference to the engravings of Tory's Hours. Having become the property
of the Kervers, as we have seen,<a name="FNanchor_391_391" id="FNanchor_391_391"></a><a href="#Footnote_391_391" class="fnanchor">[391]</a> they were used by them for a long
while. We shall mention later the octavo Hours published by Thielman II
in 1550, 1552, and 1556, in which he utilized the woodcuts of the edition
published by Olivier Mallard in 1541. His son Jacques did better than that:
in 1574 he published a large octavo edition of the Hours of the Virgin, in
which he used the woodcuts of the quarto editions issued by Tory himself
in 1524 and 1527. As the crosses were removed in almost every instance,
one might have some right to deny their source, were not the books published
by Tory a half century before, at our hand to demonstrate it. Jacques
Kerver's book being rare, and of a date subsequent to the period covered
by my work, it seems to me that it may be well to give a bibliographical
description of it, from the copy owned by M. Chedeau, which M. Potier,
bookseller, has kindly furnished me.</p>

<p>'Officium beatæ Mariæ Virginis nuper reformatum et Pii V, pont. max.,
jussu editum.&mdash;Apud Jacobum Kerver, via Jacobea, sub insigni Unicornis.&mdash;1574.'
Large octavo, with illustrations from the quarto edition published
by Tory in 1524-1525, surrounded by borders taken from Tory's quarto edition
of 1527, but reduced in size, mutilated, transposed, etc.</p>

<p>Here is a list of the plates:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span></p>

<ul class="index">
<li>1. The Annunciation (two plates).</li>
<li>2. The Salutation.</li>
<li>3. The Nativity.</li>
<li>4. The Adoration of the Shepherds.</li>
<li>5. The Adoration of the Magi.</li>
<li>6. The Circumcision.</li>
<li>7. The Flight into Egypt.</li>
<li>8. The Coronation of the Virgin.</li>
<li>These eight plates are repeated three times. Then come:&mdash;</li>
<li>9. The Triumph of Death.</li>
<li>10. David's Penance.</li>
<li>11. Jesus on the Cross.</li>
<li>12. Pentecost.</li>
</ul>


<p>Number 8 is taken from the quarto Hours of 1527; but all the others are
in the Hours of 1524-1525. Numbers 2 and 12 still bear the Lorraine cross.</p>

<p>There is no doubt in my mind that the Kervers printed also the quarto
Hours (1531) which I mentioned on page 201, and in which we find the
borders of the Hours of 1524-1525, and the porticoes of the opuscula of
1530-1531. The plates are not signed and cannot be Tory's, but as a list of
them may assist in the discovery of this edition, I will mention here those
which are at the Bibliothèque Nationale:&mdash;</p>

<ul class="index">
<li>1. The Annunciation.</li>
<li>2. The Conception.</li>
<li>3. The Visitation.</li>
<li>4. The Nativity.</li>
<li>5. The Circumcision.</li>
<li>6. The Resurrection.</li>
<li>7. The Descent of the Holy Ghost.</li>
<li>8. All Saints.</li>
<li>9. The Trinity.</li>
</ul>


<p class="p6">1547</p>

<p>We place under this date three books of Hours which introduce us to
certain engravings signed with the Lorraine cross accompanied by initials.
1547 is not the exact date of the engravings to which we refer, for we shall
see that they are of earlier execution; but their first appearance is so uncertain
that we are forced to fall back upon the definite date supplied by the
books in question.</p>

of François Regnault.) 'For sale in Paris, Rue Saint Jacques, at the sign of
the Elephant, opposite the Mathurins, by Françoys Regnault's widow.'</p>

<p>On the verso is a table of Easter-Days for thirteen years, beginning in
1547. Next comes a calendar, with engravings and verses (some in Latin,
some in French), the 'Jours moralisez,' divers moral and religious axioms,
in verse and in prose, and, lastly, the four Gospels of the Passion, in Latin.
All these form the first part, with a special series of signatures, <em>aa</em> to <em>ee</em>.
It is more than likely that this first part, which has no application to any
particular diocese, is printed, in the same form, in the Hours which Veuve
Regnault probably printed for other churches about the same time. In
signatures <em>cc</em> and <em>ee</em> there is an engraving representing Jesus on the Cross,
signed with the letters I, L, B and the Lorraine cross, which appears in
several other publications of the same period.</p>

<p>The second part of the book comprises the Hours properly so-called,
according to the ritual of the church of Toul. This part is made up of eight
signatures, <em>a</em> to <em>h</em>, the word <em>Tou</em> being printed on the first page of each
sheet.</p>

<p>The volume contains a hundred leaves in all. In addition to the bookseller's
mark and the engraving signed with the Lorraine cross, there are
55 large woodcuts, most of which are signed with the initials I, M (without
the cross), a few small engravings, and a large number of letters in
grisaille, but no borders.</p>

<p>With a copy of these Hours, which I have seen, was bound the following
work:&mdash;</p>

<p>'The fifteen effusions of the blood of our Saviour and Redeemer Jesus
Christ, by Barbe Regnault, Rue Saint Jacques, at the sign of the Elephant,
opposite the Mathurins.' Eight leaves in two octavo folds, enriched with
fifteen pretty woodcuts, interspersed through the text, and marked, like
the one mentioned above, which is one of them, with the letters I, L, B
and the Lorraine cross.</p>

<p>This little volume is undated, but it is known that Barbe Regnault succeeded
her mother, Madeleine Boursette, widow of François Regnault,
who was carrying on the business as late as 1555. So that the engravings
with the initials I, L, B might be of later date than that; but we have seen
that one of them had already appeared in the first part of the book; therefore
they are of earlier date than 1547.</p>

<p>Here is a list of these engravings, which are the same ones mentioned
by M. Robert-Dumesnil under date of 1599:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span></p>

<li>6. Jesus King of the Jews.</li>
<li>7. Jesus Bearing his Cross.</li>

<li>13. Erection of the Cross.</li>
<li>14. Jesus between the two Thieves.</li>
<li>15. Same subject (without cross or initials).</li>
</ul>

<p>All of these are 4&frac12; centimetres high and 5 wide.</p>

<p>The 'Fifteen Effusions' was reprinted frequently during the sixteenth
century, in different formats and in different type, but with the same engravings,
and almost always without date, because it was added to other
books. I have, however, seen one copy in large type, dated 1584 (Bibliothèque
Nationale). These same engravings appear, with many others, in
a work entitled 'Abrégé des Méditations de la vie de Jésus-Christ'; octavo,
Paris, Guillaume Chaudière, 1599.</p>

<p>On the verso of the title, 'a calendar for <span class="smcapa">XI</span> years,' beginning with 1548.
Each month has its engraving, and the usual illustration is placed within
a circle; they are not signed.</p>

<p>Printed in red and black, in large gothic type, the work consists of 8
preliminary leaves and 16 folios of text, signatures A to Q, with the letters
<em>Pa</em> (Paris). The folios do not begin until signature B, and run without
a break to the end of signature Q. On the last page of this signature are
these words: 'These present hours according to the use of Paris, with several
noble eulogies of Our Lady, have been printed by Veufve Jehan de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>

<p>Then follow 12 leaves of appendix, ending with a figure of the Virgin,
over which are the words 'Nostre Dame de Lorette,' in roman capitals. At
the foot of the page: 'Ave Sanctissima Maria,' etc. (5 lines in gothic type).</p>

<p>This curious volume is preserved in the Bibliothèque Nationale.</p>

<p>Besides the 12 small engravings of the calendar, there are several other
small subjects, also unsigned, and 13 large ones with the letters L, R, and the
double cross. These latter, which measure 10 centimetres in height and 7 in
width, are as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. St. John writing his Gospel.</p>

<p>2. The Annunciation.</p>

<p>3. The Visitation.</p>

<p>4. The Crucifixion.</p>

<p>5. The Descent of the Holy Ghost upon the Apostles (with the initials,
but without the cross).</p>

<p>6. The Birth of Jesus.</p>

<p>7. The Annunciation to the Shepherds.</p>

<p>8. The Adoration of the Magi.</p>

<p>9. The Circumcision.</p>

<p>10. The Coronation of the Virgin.</p>

<p>11. The Penance of David. He is saying to the Father Eternal these
words, which are written in a scroll: 'I who have sinned.'<a name="FNanchor_392_392" id="FNanchor_392_392"></a><a href="#Footnote_392_392" class="fnanchor">[392]</a></p>

<p>13. Notre-Dame de Lorette.</p>

<p>As I have said heretofore (supra, p. 149), the first twelve of these are
improved copies of other, unsigned engravings, belonging to Thielman
Kerver I, which appear in many books published by him or by his widow,
Iolande Bonhomme, at least as early as 1522,<a name="FNanchor_394_394" id="FNanchor_394_394"></a><a href="#Footnote_394_394" class="fnanchor">[394]</a> and which we find again in
the Paris missal published by their son Jacques in 1559.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span></p>

<p>M. Brunet<a name="FNanchor_395_395" id="FNanchor_395_395"></a><a href="#Footnote_395_395" class="fnanchor">[395]</a> suggests a very plausible theory, to the effect that the engravings
signed L. R. were executed by Louis Royer, who was in fact the
first to use them, in a book of Hours entitled: 'Horæ beatæ Mariæ ad usum
Rom.'; duodecimo, gothic type, with the mark of Jean de Brie, and the following
words at the foot: 'Parisiis, impressum in vico Jacobi per Claudium
Chevallon, impensis Ludovici Royer, librarii Parisiensis, in eodem vico commorante,
ad insigne vulgariter dictum la Lymace.'</p>

<p>The book is not dated; but we see, on the one hand, that it was printed
by Claude Chevallon, who died in 1542, and, on the other hand, that Louis
Royer, at whose expense it was printed, had succeeded Jean de Brie at the
sign of the Snail. Now, the latter died about 1522; so that it was between
1522 and 1542 that this book saw the light, and that the engravings with
the letters L. R. first appeared.</p>

<p>We know nothing of this Louis Royer, whom Lottin does not mention.
Nor do we know any more of Jean de Brie's widow, who seems to have
succeeded Louis Royer. And, as if everything in this matter were fated
to remain obscure, we find other octavo Hours according to the use of
Rome, in French gothic type, undated, but with a calendar from 1568
to 1578, printed with the same woodcuts, and for sale 'at Paris, on Rue
Saint Jacques, at the sign of the Snail'; with no other details. In the book
we have described we find also:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. The Virgin and the Child Jesus (signed with the letters L. R. and the
cross).</p>

<p>2. Jesus betrayed by Judas (same marks).</p>

<p>Octavo, gothic type; printed in red and black. This book, which I saw
at the sale of M. Chedeau's library, is illustrated with engravings, most of
them signed with the Lorraine cross, to which the initials G. M. are sometimes
added. They are 8 centimetres high by 55 millimetres wide. The list
follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. Saint John writing his Gospel (unsigned).</p>

<p>2. The Annunciation (unsigned).</p>

<p>3. The Visitation (signed with the Lorraine cross and the initials G. M.).</p>

<p>4. The Nativity (signed with the Lorraine cross only).</p>

<p>5. The Annunciation to the Shepherds (the cross only).</p>

<p>6. The Adoration of the Magi (the cross only).</p>

<p>7. The Circumcision (the cross only).</p>

<p>8. The Flight into Egypt (unsigned).</p>

<p>9. The Coronation of the Virgin (the cross only).</p>

<p>10. The Descent of the Holy Ghost upon the Apostles (signed with the
letters G. M. and the Lorraine cross in a small circle).</p>

<p>11. Jesus on the Cross (the cross only).</p>

<p>12. Bathsheba (the cross only).</p>

<p>13. Job (the cross only).</p>

<p>We think that we can safely attribute the designing of these engravings
to Guillaume Merlin, the publisher of this book of Hours. They must, at
all events, be much earlier than 1548, for we have already seen one of them
(no. 10) in a book of 1541 (supra, p. 217).</p>

<p>Guillaume Merlin also published about 1559 a book of Hours embellished
with engravings signed with the Lorraine cross. It is entitled:
'Heures à l'usage de Romme' [<em>sic</em>], and is undated, but has a calendar
from 1559 to 1570. It is a small octavo, printed in gothic characters, in
red and black. At the end are the words: 'Printed by Jean Bridier.'</p>

<p>We find in this volume, which was in M. Chedeau's library, 12 engravings
representing the twelve months of the year. Three of them are
signed with the Lorraine cross, namely, January, May and December.
The others have no mark. They are 10 centimetres high by 7 wide. On
folio 62 verso is the Virgin holding the Child Jesus. She is within an
aureole of flames, with her feet on a crescent.</p>

<p>The inscription 'An. 29,' at the top of the portrait, indicates that it
was engraved in the same year that the book was printed; for Théodore
de Bèze, born at Vezelay June 24, 1519, completed his twenty-ninth year
in 1548, the date of the dedicatory epistle of this book, which the author
addressed to his teacher, Melchior Volmar. 'Vale. Lutetiæ, <span class="smcapa">VII.</span> cal. Iul.

Lorraine cross, is on the first page of this book, which was finished on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>

this same year, that Théodore de Bèze, on recovering from a severe illness,
withdrew to Geneva, and abjured 'the papacy, as he had sworn to
God to do at the age of sixteen.' The portrait has been reproduced on copper;
there is a copy of the reproduction in the collection of Tory's work at
the Bibliothèque Nationale.</p>

portraits, all marked with the Lorraine cross, are faithful reproductions

<p>There were two editions of this book, or, at all events, there are some
copies with additions to the second part&mdash;after folio 34. There are also
copies with the imprint of Jean Dallier. A list of the engravings follows:</p>

<p>1. A portico, above which we see Hercules holding, bound together
by the ears (by means of a chain issuing from his mouth and representing
eloquence), a wood-chopper, a soldier, a priest, and a noble (folio 4).
I can find no mark on this piece, but it is a reproduction of the Gallic
Hercules of 'Champ fleury.'</p>

<p>2. A fountain (folio 5 verso).</p>

<p>3. A triumphal arch surmounted by the arms of France (folio 9).</p>

<p>4. An obelisk on a rhinoceros (folio 11). The cross is under the left
foot of the rhinoceros.</p>

<p>5. A peristyle with pillars (folio 13).</p>

<p>6. A triumphal arch surmounted by three nude men, one of whom
holds a standard (folio 15).</p>

<p>7. A large vaulted hall, on the ceiling of which are H's and D's (folio
16). The cross is in a portico at the left.</p>

<p>8. A mounted man, armed (folio 19). The cross is in the horse's
harness, on the breastplate, a little below his mouth.</p>

<p>9. A triumphal arch, with two pillars (one on each side) surmounted
by a man on horseback (folio 38). The cross is on the left-hand pillar.</p>

<p>10. A portico with two openings, separated by a pillar against which
rests the statue of a woman standing on books (folio 39 verso).</p>

<p>11. A large plate, representing the façade of a palace with three porticos
(folio 40).</p>

<p>Of these eleven plates only four are signed; but all of them must
have come from Tory's workshop, for the style is the same. The absence
of the signature may be explained by the haste with which the
engravings were executed in order that they might appear at the opportune
moment.</p>

<p>I cannot refrain from quoting M. Renouvier's remarks on the engravings
in this book, which, for lack of information, he attributed to
Jean Cousin.</p>

<p>'I will, however, mention in this place the "Entrée de Henri II à<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
Paris" in 1549, because it is the chef-d'œuvre of French wood-engraving,
and because I know of no one to whom it can with more reason
be attributed than to the Sénonais master.<a name="FNanchor_397_397" id="FNanchor_397_397"></a><a href="#Footnote_397_397" class="fnanchor">[397]</a> If he did not work for the
court, he may very well have been employed upon works for the city.
Those which were executed to commemorate the coronation of Queen
Catherine de Medici are of a manner of composition and a style that
belong only to him. The Gallic Hercules, made in the likeness of the
late King François I, with the four estates of the realm chained to his
mouth; the fountain surmounted by statues of the Seine, the Marne,
and Good Fortune; the triumphal arch bearing a Typhis, whose face
strongly resembles that of the "rex triumphans"; and, lastly, the figure
of Lutetia nova Pandora "clad as a nymph, with her hair falling over her
shoulders and drawn about her face, kneeling on one knee with wondrous
grace"; and all the other details which the artist painted, as happening
in the streets through which the procession passed, and which
he included by way of narrative, are in the refined manner of the French
school. The drawing is pure and full of delicacy, and the engraving so
skilfully handled that one cannot believe it to be by a different hand. It
would seem that none but a sculptor could, within such narrow limits,
have set in relief those interesting faces, designed those graceful figures,
and arranged those draperies; and that sculptor&mdash;who could it have
been if not the author of the mausoleum of Admiral Chabot, the French
artist who best represented the two sides of art,&mdash;detail and strength,
compression and grandeur, gothicism and the Renaissance?'<a name="FNanchor_398_398" id="FNanchor_398_398"></a><a href="#Footnote_398_398" class="fnanchor">[398]</a></p>

<p>While agreeing with M. Renouvier that these plates were drawn by
Jean Cousin, we may well, it seems to me, attribute the engraving of
them to Tory's workshop.</p>

have removed a French inscription which appeared below the third
plate (the Angelic Salutation) in the edition of 1543; and they have removed
all the dates inscribed in the borders of that edition. These dates
are: 1536, which appeared in large figures in a cartouche at the foot of
the border of folio <em>b</em> 4 of the edition of 1543; 1537, in a cartouche at the
foot of the sixth plate (the Annunciation to the Shepherds); and 1539,
in two small cartouches at the top of the border of folio <em>a</em> 2; so that all
the cartouches are empty in this edition of 1549.</p>

<p>I know of only two copies of this edition, one belonging to M. Kühnholtz,
the learned librarian of the Faculty of Medicine of Montpellier,
the other offered for sale at Claudin's bookshop in 1860. This last copy,
in a state of perfect preservation, is still in its original binding, with S's
<em>barré</em>, and small tortoises (<em>tortues</em>) in wreaths of olive. These are the allusive<a name="FNanchor_400_400" id="FNanchor_400_400"></a><a href="#Footnote_400_400" class="fnanchor">[400]</a>
arms of the Tourteron family near Attigny. There is also, on one
of the fly-leaves at the front of the book, a large tortoise coloured from
life, on a red ground, in a green olive wreath; and at the four corners a
monogram of an I and two G's, the initials of the original owner's baptismal
names. The volume afterwards belonged to J.-F. Corel du Clos,
priest and canon, who wrote his name on the title-page and pasted his
arms, engraved on copper, in an empty space at the foot of folio <em>h</em> 3
verso. Du Clos seems to have parted with it to the Cordeliers of Rheims,
in whose library it remained doubtless until the Revolution.</p>

<p>A large folio of more than 600 leaves, printed at Paris by François
Girault. The privilege, in the name of Sertenas, bookseller, is dated October
1, 1549. It was issued evidently while the printing was in progress,
for it is impossible that the volume was made in a month and a half.</p>

<p>On the first page is the fine frontispiece of the Dream of Poliphilus,
above which is the mark of Jacques Kerver. There is but one way to explain
this fact, and that is to assume that Kerver was the printer of the
book. It may be that there are copies in his name. In that case he may
have furnished the border, which was left in all the copies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span></p>

<p>On the second leaf is the representation of the 'Ymage de nostre
Dame de Verdun,' with the Lorraine cross. The Virgin, seated, has in
her right hand a flower, and in the left the Child Jesus, holding in his
left hand the globe surmounted by a cross. The Virgin's feet rest on a
winged dragon. Below her is a man kneeling, with his coat-of-arms before
him. Presumably it is the author of the book.</p>

<p>After folio cccli, which concludes the first volume, comes the second
volume, the pagination of which follows on. The title-page of this volume,
while it is set in the border of the Poliphilus, differs slightly from
that of the first. It reads thus: 'Second volume des antiquités de la Gaule
Belgique et de plusieurs principautez contenues en icelle, extraites soubs
les vies des evesques de Verdun, par M. Richard de Wassebourg.... On
les vend à Paris, en la gallerie du Palais, par Vincent Sertenas, libraire audit
lieu. Et aussi, se vend en la cité de Verdun.' On the verso is the engraving
described above. The Lorraine cross is under the dragon's tail.</p>

<p>This fine volume, printed by Pasquier Letellier for the bookseller
Vincent Sertenas, for whom Tory had engraved a mark, contains fifty
engravings in the text. A single one is signed with the Lorraine cross:
it is found on folio 137 verso, and represents a lion fawning upon a
woman who sits beside a fountain.</p>

'Dear reader,' he says, 'if you have noticed, on reading this book,

letter, which is not pronounced according to the true French method,
think not that that is of my doing, but that it accords with the earnest

<p>This missal is embellished, on the title-page, with a cut signed with
the Lorraine cross, and representing Saint Peter and Saint Paul, patron
saints of the Abbey of Cluny. This cut appears in other parts of the book,
where we find also the two large cuts hitherto described (page 214) as
included in the Missal of Paris, of 1539, published by order of Jean de Bellay.
We find also a Saint John Baptist, with the Paschal Lamb under
his left arm, and pointing to it with his right hand. This cut, which is
signed in two different places, is on folio 49 of the second part. It is of
quarto size.</p>

<p>The book is in two parts, paged separately. The two large engravings
are on folios 116 and 117 of the first part. At the end of the Missal
proper, which is followed by a few other leaves, are these words: 'Ex
officina chalcographica matrone clarissime Iolande Bonhomme, vidue

<p>There are several copies of this book in the Bibliothèque Nationale.
In two of them the miniaturists have substituted for the date 1538,
printed on one of the large cuts, the dates on which they coloured it&mdash;1559
and 1567, respectively. It is well to call attention to such details
as these, which may give rise to mistakes.</p>

properly a dedication, for in it Le Duaren mentions the death of Marguerite,
which took place in 1549. He tells us, further, in the title of this
epistle, that it was written before his return to Bourges, which he had
been obliged to leave in 1547, as the result of a love-affair ('antequam Lutetia
Parisiorum Avaricum Biturigum migrasset').<a name="FNanchor_408_408" id="FNanchor_408_408"></a><a href="#Footnote_408_408" class="fnanchor">[408]</a></p>

<p>This important work is embellished with a frieze engraved for Robert
Estienne, and signed with the Lorraine cross,&mdash;a frieze which appears
in the second volume of the works of Eusebius of 1544.<a name="FNanchor_409_409" id="FNanchor_409_409"></a><a href="#Footnote_409_409" class="fnanchor">[409]</a> We also find<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>

the E, the O, and the S of the medium alphabet,&mdash;for there are three
alphabets of different sizes, all three formed by Renaissance arabesques.
The largest is the one used in the folio Eusebius of 1544, which, consequently,
was engraved for Robert Estienne; but it has no signature. The
medium alphabet was, doubtless, engraved for Charles Estienne in this
same year 1551, in which he began to conduct a printing-office. I cannot
say whether any other letters of this medium alphabet bore the Lorraine
cross, for they do not all appear in the book, but I am sure that the
G has none. Of course, after Tory died, the artists employed in the establishment
carried on by his widow had no reason to select the G
rather than another letter.</p>

<p>I give some details concerning this valuable edition, of which M.
Didot owned a copy annotated by Henri Estienne. The text of the first
volume, printed in 1551, as stated in an imprint at the end (dated the
3d of the Nones of September), exhibits one of the letters mentioned
above&mdash;the S (on folios 56 and 298). This volume received later a
large title-page dated 1555, and a dedication, to the Cardinal de Lorraine,
also dated 1555 (the 6th of the Kalends of March), on which we
find the frieze of the Eusebius of 1544, signed, and bearing on a medallion
Fame distributing wreaths.<a name="FNanchor_411_411" id="FNanchor_411_411"></a><a href="#Footnote_411_411" class="fnanchor">[411]</a> The text of the second volume,
also of 1551, as I discovered from an incomplete copy in the library at
Montbrison (it has no final imprint, but on the title-page some one has
added <span class="smcapa">III</span> by hand to the original numerals <span class="smcapa">M. D. LI</span>, so that it might
correspond with the other copies), contains the three floriated letters
signed with the Lorraine cross (folios 47, 122, 230, 313, 388, 398); we
find also, on the title-page, dated 1554, Charles Estienne's small mark
described later.<a name="FNanchor_412_412" id="FNanchor_412_412"></a><a href="#Footnote_412_412" class="fnanchor">[412]</a> The text of the third volume was probably printed in
1552, but it has no final imprint. The title-page is dated 1555; it has
the small mark with the Lorraine cross. The fourth bears on the title-page
the date 1554, but it was not finished until 1555, as is shown by
the final imprint (3d of the Kalends of March, 1555); the vignette of
the title-page is unlike that in the second and third volumes, although
of the same size, and has not the cross. The work did not appear until
1555, as is shown by the date on the title-page of the first volume, on
which there is another larger mark, also without the cross.<a name="FNanchor_413_413" id="FNanchor_413_413"></a><a href="#Footnote_413_413" class="fnanchor">[413]</a></p>

<p>This book contains 120 engravings inserted in the text, and serving
thus 'to illustrate,' as we should say to-day, or 'to express,' as the publisher
says on the title-page, the Gospels and the Apocalypse. Those relating
to the Apocalypse, 22 in number, are of earlier date than the
others, and by another hand. Of those which illustrate the Gospels,
many are signed with the double cross. Although several of them relate
to subjects previously treated in the octavo Hours of 1527 and the sixteenmo
Hours of 1529, the engravings, while they are of nearly the same
size, are different none the less. A list of their titles follows:&mdash;</p>

This portrait reappears, but without the inscription, in several other
editions of Ronsard. I will mention particularly the quarto edition of
his works, issued in 1567 by Gabriel Buon, successor to Maurice de la
Porte's widow, and the folio issued in 1623 by Nicolas Buon, Gabriel's son.</p>

<p>There were two editions of this book, printed by Benoît Prevost,
for Gilles Corrozet and Guillaume Cavellat, respectively, in 1553 and
1554. The copies in Corrozet's name bear his mark, signed with the
Lorraine cross. There is a portrait of Belon signed with the cross at
the end of the front matter in the edition of 1554. I have not seen it
in any copy of the edition of 1553, which leads me to think that it had
not then been engraved. And, in effect, the fact that the portrait attributes
to Belon the age of thirty-six years seems to show that it was not
drawn until 1554, as Belon is supposed to have been born in 1518.
However that may be, the portrait appeared afterward in several other
books by the same author, and particularly in his 'Histoire de la nature
des oiseaux,' folio, 1555.</p>

<p>In this book we find, in addition to the portrait of Belon, seven cuts
of birds, signed with the Lorraine cross. They are: the osprey, folio 96;
the sea-gull, 169; the bustard, 238; the pullet, 252; the loriot, 295; the
woodpecker, 304; the sparrow-hawk, 376. Some of the other engravings

<p>This rare and curious volume is a quarto of 8 preliminary leaves,
166 leaves of text, and 2 of index unnumbered,&mdash;in all, 46 signatures.
The privilege, which is printed on the verso of the title-page, is dated
Saint-Germain-en-Laye, December 18, 1556. In the dedication, addressed
to the Cardinal of Sens, Jean Bertrand, first Keeper of the Seals
of France, Thevet says that the country described by him maybe called
the fourth part of the world, 'for that no one has as yet made explora<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>tions
there, all geographers thinking that the world is limited to that
which the ancients have described to us.'</p>

<p>There are 41 engravings in the text, not including borders, floriated
letters, and Jean Bertrand's arms on the title-page. Of the 41, only seven
are signed with the double cross; four of these represent scenes in the life
of the American savage,&mdash;they are on folios 6 verso, 31 recto, 47 verso,
and 151 recto; a fifth represents an extraordinary bird called <i>pa</i> (45
recto); and the other two, plants,&mdash;the pineapple (89 verso), and the
cassava (113 verso). The last three appear in André Thevet's 'Cosmographie
Universelle,' published in 1575, in two volumes, folio.<a name="FNanchor_418_418" id="FNanchor_418_418"></a><a href="#Footnote_418_418" class="fnanchor">[418]</a> The
others also appear in that work, but reëngraved on a larger scale, and
without signature.</p>

<p>The seven engravings signed with the double cross cannot have been
executed prior to 1556. For Thevet set out for the New World on
November 4, 1555,<a name="FNanchor_419_419" id="FNanchor_419_419"></a><a href="#Footnote_419_419" class="fnanchor">[419]</a> and remained there four months. So that it was
not until the early months of 1556, at the earliest, that the engravings
could have been executed. But, as the book did not appear until the
beginning of 1558,<a name="FNanchor_420_420" id="FNanchor_420_420"></a><a href="#Footnote_420_420" class="fnanchor">[420]</a> it may be that they were still in process of execution
in 1557.</p>

<p>In the same year with the publication of Thevet's 'Singularités,' an
octavo edition appeared at Antwerp, with the imprint of Christophe
Plantin, and a privilege from the King of Spain, dated Brussels, April
20, 1558. The haste with which this reprint was prepared shows the
interest with which the book was regarded. The woodcuts of the Antwerp
edition are nothing more than wretched copies of those in the
Paris edition. We find among them, however, in chapters 56, 58, 67,
and 74, cuts of animals bearing the cipher of Jost Amman.</p>

<p>This little volume, printed in Greek and Latin, two columns on a
page, was called to my attention by M. Lornier, barrister, of Rouen.
Opposite the first page of text is a small engraving, signed with the Lorraine
cross, representing the penance of David. David is on his knees,
with a book before him and his harp at his right hand; he is gazing at
God the Father, who is seen in the sky blessing him. Doubtless this engraving
appears in other books of earlier date. It is 73 millimetres high
by 55 wide.</p>

<p>A large plate, 35 centimetres in width by 27 in height, divided into two
parts by a tree at the foot of which is Man, thus placed on the boundary
of the two worlds. The tree bears only withered branches on the left side
(the old alliance), whereas, on the right (the new alliance), it is green and
flourishing.</p>

<p>In the compartment at the left we see Adam and Eve in the Garden
of Eden. Eve is offering Adam the apple. Beneath them is the word
'peche.'<a name="FNanchor_423_423" id="FNanchor_423_423"></a><a href="#Footnote_423_423" class="fnanchor">[423]</a> Lower still is a skeleton on a bier, with the words 'la mort'
beneath. Above the Garden is Mount Sinai, whereon Moses is receiving
the tables of the law; beneath, on the right, the 'terrestrial Jerusalem,'
wherein are devout persons being devoured by serpents, with
the serpent of brass in the midst, and above it the words, 'Similitvde de
la ivstification.' Moses appears on the right; at the left, and a little lower,
Hagar and Ishmael; lower still, the prophet pointing out to Man Jesus
on the Cross at the right.</p>

<p>In the compartment at the right we see God standing on the terrestrial
globe, with the words, 'Iervsalem celeste'; above, 'Mont Sion,' on
which stands a woman's figure, with the words 'La Grace' over her
head. An angel bearing a cross descends from Heaven (where are the
words, 'Emmanvel Diev avec novs') amid rays of light which fall upon
the woman. Lower, at the left, is another angel announcing the birth
of Christ to the shepherds. Near by, at the right, the Christ on the Cross,
with the words, 'nostre ivstice,' and the Paschal Lamb, with the words,
'nostre innocence'; below, Jesus coming forth from the tomb, with the
words, 'nostre victoire'; still lower, at the left, St. John Baptist pointing
out to Man the Christ on the Cross; the Forerunner is indicated by
the words, 'Lenseignevr de Christ,' in a cartouche; above St. John are
Sarah and Isaac.</p>

in the Bibliothèque Nationale, and was for a long time attributed
to Jean Cousin. It was M. Devéria who removed it from that
artist's work and placed it with Tory's, whose double cross it bears, at the
left, below the cartouche containing the words 'Lenseignevr de Christ.'
I believe that it belongs in some large folio Bible; for I have seen the
subject treated in a more or less summary fashion<a name="FNanchor_425_425" id="FNanchor_425_425"></a><a href="#Footnote_425_425" class="fnanchor">[425]</a> on the title-pages
of several Bibles, in French and other languages. I will mention particularly
the following, all of which are in the Bibliothèque Nationale.
(1) A French Bible, printed at Antwerp in 1530, by Martin l'Empereur;
(2) A Bible in old Saxon, printed at Lubeck in 1533 by Ludowich Dietz
(the same woodcuts reappear in an edition in Danish, issued by the same
printer, at Copenhagen, in 1550); (3) A Bible in Latin, from the text of
Erasmus, published in 1543 or 1544, with two engravings by Cranach;
(4) A Bible in Flemish, printed at Antwerp in 1556. I will mention also
Luther's Latin Commentaries ('enarrationes') on the Bible, printed at
Nuremberg in 1555, with an engraving on the title-page dated 1552.</p>

<p>Whatever its source, this drawing was reproduced in 1562, on a large
enamelled plate in tinted grisaille, attributed to Pierre Rexmond, enameller,
at Limoges. The sketch for this plate was published in 1843, after
a copy in the collection of M. Baron, in the volume entitled 'Meubles
et Armes du moyen âge,' a large quarto, published by Hauser, dealer in
prints on Boulevard des Italiens.<a name="FNanchor_426_426" id="FNanchor_426_426"></a><a href="#Footnote_426_426" class="fnanchor">[426]</a> It is no. 127 in the collection. In this
drawing the groups are arranged in chronological order, the circular
form of the plate making it impossible to retain the arrangement of
the engraving. But the various subjects and their respective inscriptions
are identical, save for the errors in orthography with which the Limousin
artist has besprinkled the latter. The two Jerusalems are separated
by two trees, which, starting at the outer border of the plate,
formed of Renaissance arabesques, join their heads at the centre, where
there is a medallion containing the face of Marguerite de Valois, sister
of François I.<a name="FNanchor_427_427" id="FNanchor_427_427"></a><a href="#Footnote_427_427" class="fnanchor">[427]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span></p>

<p>This subject has been treated also in a cameo now in the Bibliothèque
Nationale, but in a very summary fashion because of the small size of
the piece, which is only 57 millimetres in width by 72 in height. All
the essential details of the engraving are reproduced. A description of
this interesting cameo will be found under no. 317, in the 'Notice du
Cabinet des médailles,' published by M. Chabouillet, one of the conservators
of that priceless collection. It has been reproduced, too, in the
collection of 'Mémoires de la Société des antiquaires de Morinie,' and
the curious feature of the business is that the engraver has taken for his
mark the arms of the city of Saint-Omer, which are the Lorraine cross.</p>

<p>Folio; one volume in two parts, Paris, J. du Puys, 1580.</p>

<p>This volume is an exact reproduction of the manuscript preserved
at the Bibliothèque Nationale, which I have already described.<a name="FNanchor_429_429" id="FNanchor_429_429"></a><a href="#Footnote_429_429" class="fnanchor">[429]</a> Although
dedicated to Charles IX, the book was prepared for publication
at a much earlier date. In fact, the author tells us, in the dedicatory epistle,
that he had presented a copy to Henri II; indeed, it seems that he
had it prepared for printing at the insistence of the King and Queen, who
had promised 'to take care of the expenses.' This fact explains why almost
all the portraits of the kings of France, from Clovis to François I,
are signed with the Lorraine cross. These portraits are copied from the
miniatures of the manuscript, but are on a smaller scale; furthermore
they are in oval instead of square borders.</p>

<p>Du Tillet died in 1570, before he was able to carry out his project
of printing this work. On August 10, 1578,<a name="FNanchor_430_430" id="FNanchor_430_430"></a><a href="#Footnote_430_430" class="fnanchor">[430]</a> his heirs obtained a license
to publish their 'late father's' work, which finally appeared in 1580;
in fact, one part is dated 1579. They made use of the woodcuts bearing
the Lorraine cross. Jean du Puys, the publisher,<a name="FNanchor_431_431" id="FNanchor_431_431"></a><a href="#Footnote_431_431" class="fnanchor">[431]</a> added to the book some
portraits which are not in the manuscript (among others those of Henri
II and Charles IX), and which consequently do not bear Tory's mark.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span></p>

<p>Following is a complete list of the portraits contained in this volume,
with indication of those not in the manuscript and of those signed
with the Lorraine cross.</p>

<p>It will be seen that there are, in all, 10<a name="FNanchor_432_432" id="FNanchor_432_432"></a><a href="#Footnote_432_432" class="fnanchor">[432]</a> portraits added to those found
in the manuscript. For the other princes mentioned in the work, whose
features it was impossible to present, empty frames are printed. Naturally,
none of the portraits added to du Tillet's book by the editor are
marked with the Lorraine cross, and of the other 31, there are only 15<a name="FNanchor_433_433" id="FNanchor_433_433"></a><a href="#Footnote_433_433" class="fnanchor">[433]</a>
on which it is found.</p>

<p>These cuts were reproduced in a great many later editions of du Tillet's
work, both folio and quarto. I will mention particularly those of
1586, 1587, 1602, 1607, and 1608.</p>

<p>The volume contains also many engravings of shields and seals.</p>

<p>On the title-pages of these two volumes, both of which are in the Bibliothèque
Nationale, there is a woodcut signed with the Lorraine cross,
representing a cross with the crown of thorns, set in a border of the size
of a five-franc piece. It was undoubtedly engraved long before 1598.</p>

<p>Quarto, Troyes, 1850 and 1859. The first fascicle of this book, which
consists of a collection of old woodcuts gathered by M. Varlot in the
printing-offices of Troyes, contains two signed with the Lorraine cross.
They are nos. 50 and 188. The first represents the Coronation of the
Virgin; we may join with it a piece in the same manner representing
the Visitation, no. 51 in the same collection; and no. 5 (the Virgin holding
the Child Jesus) of the fascicle published in 1859. These cuts, which
are in format a small folio, doubtless formed part of a series of engravings
relating to the Virgin and intended for a book of Hours.</p>

<p>MM. Alexis Socard and Alexandre Assier, in their work entitled
'Livres liturgiques du diocèse de Troyes' (8vo, 1863), also give, on page<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
79, an old Troyes woodcut, small folio, signed with the double cross,
representing the Descent of the Holy Ghost on the Virgin and the
Apostles. It is 135 millimetres high by 60 in width.</p>

<p>No. 188 of M. Varlot's fascicle, which is only one inch high by two
wide, represents a harvest. It was undoubtedly one of a series of engravings
illustrative of the twelve months. MM. Socard and Assier saw it in
a book of Hours printed at Troyes in 1583, by Jean du Ruan, who seems
to have inherited a portion of the woodcuts of Jean Le Coq, printer,
of the same city. We find also in M. Varlot's collection two woodcuts
marked with the letters G. T., which may have been Geofroy Tory's
earlier mark, before he had adopted a special symbol. These two are
no. 84, in the criblé style, and no. 131, in the Renaissance style.<a name="FNanchor_434_434" id="FNanchor_434_434"></a><a href="#Footnote_434_434" class="fnanchor">[434]</a></p>

<p>On account of the worn state of these cuts it is impossible to say
whether they are originals or copies. It is not impossible, however,
that they were executed by Tory for the printer Nicole Paris, or rather
for Jean Le Coq, whose mark he engraved also.<a name="FNanchor_435_435" id="FNanchor_435_435"></a><a href="#Footnote_435_435" class="fnanchor">[435]</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcapa">VI.</span> Not only at Paris and Troyes do we find woodcuts with the Lorraine
cross; we find them also at Orléans, at Chartres, at Poitiers, and
even at Lyon, although the last-named city had a most flourishing school
of engraving of its own; witness the illustrations of the Bible after Holbein,<a name="FNanchor_436_436" id="FNanchor_436_436"></a><a href="#Footnote_436_436" class="fnanchor">[436]</a>
published by Jean Frellon, in 1547, and those of Salomon Bernard,
published by the de Tournes after 1553. But the works executed by Tory
for Simon de Colines, Robert Estienne, and the rest, had so spread his
name abroad, that there was not a printer of taste in France who did
not seek the honour of obtaining some work of our artist. In this way
Jean de Tournes, first of the name, who was unquestionably one of the
most famous printers of Lyon, had engraved by Tory, or by his widow,
borders and pictures in considerable numbers; unfortunately we find
very few of them signed, whether because Tory's mark was afterward
removed from the others, or because he omitted to place it upon them,
in accordance with the wish of Jean de Tournes; for in those days printers
were very desirous to appropriate the engravings that they ordered,
especially at Lyon, where, nominally at least, no other engraver was
known than Salomon Bernard; moreover, it is well to note that that
artist, none of whose work is signed, is known only because his name<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
was afterward published by the printers, in the very interest of their
publications.</p>

<p>However, I propose to give a list of the pieces signed with the Lorraine
cross which I have seen in books published by the de Tournes,
that is, by Jean I and Jean II, his son; for it is impossible, in default of
any sort of a catalogue, for me to decide what ones are attributable to
each of them. As a matter of fact, I should be justified in confining
myself to the second, if he had not himself said that he used woodcuts
belonging to his father. And, in truth, although we know of no books
published by the latter with engravings, except his edition of Petrarch
of 1545 (reprinted in 1547), and his book of Chiromancy and Physiognomy,
also of 1545, octavo, everything seems to indicate that those
marked with the Lorraine cross were made for Jean I, who died about
1550.</p>

<p>The first book that I shall mention is an octavo volume, without
title, described thus by M. Didot in his 'Essai sur la Gravure,' col. 235;
'Pamphlet without title, printed on one side only, with this imprint on
page 1: "A Lion, Ian de Tournes, 1551." The border, composed of arabesques
in white on a black ground, has at the foot the Lorraine cross.
Twenty-two of these engravings represent scenes from the theatre of
the ancients; the ninth bears the Lorraine cross.' This pamphlet was
reprinted in 1556, as we shall see in a moment.</p>

<p>The second book that I shall mention is an octavo volume, without
date, entitled: 'Thesaurus amicorum,' which is in the Bibliothèque Nationale.
It contains three series of borders: (1) Borders with arabesques
in black on a white ground (one of them is signed with a very small
Lorraine cross); (2) Borders with arabesques in white on a black ground
(one of these also is signed with a small white cross); (3) Borders with
grotesque subjects, licentious and otherwise. These last, none of which
are signed, represent figures analogous to those that are found in the
'Songes drolatiques' attributed to Rabelais, and seem to be modelled
upon them.</p>

<p>In the first part of the book, the borders, 32 in number, are empty<a name="FNanchor_437_437" id="FNanchor_437_437"></a><a href="#Footnote_437_437" class="fnanchor">[437]</a>;
in the second part, they enclose medallions of famous characters of ancient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
times, with mottoes in all sorts of languages. There are 96 of these
portraits. They were reproduced, with many others, in a book printed in
1559, under the title, 'Insignium aliquot virorum icones' (octavo).<a name="FNanchor_438_438" id="FNanchor_438_438"></a><a href="#Footnote_438_438" class="fnanchor">[438]</a> In
the dedication, to G. Tuffano, 'gymnasiarchæ Nemausensi,' Jean de
Tournes, second of the name, the printer of the book, informs us that he
undertook it in order to utilize the woodcuts left by his father. 'Cum
pater jamdudum haberet hasce icones inutiles ne omnino perirent, hæc
pauca, quæ huic opusculo insunt, ex variis auctoribus accumulavi....'
In this book the medallions number one hundred and forty-three; none
are signed, but they are altogether in Tory's manner.</p>

<p>These same medallions, as well as the borders of the 'Thesaurus amicorum,'
have been used in a multitude of other publications, which are
known to us only through detached fragments. I will mention particularly
eight leaves preserved in the Cabinet des Estampes, printed on one
side only, having a border with a portrait on each page.<a name="FNanchor_439_439" id="FNanchor_439_439"></a><a href="#Footnote_439_439" class="fnanchor">[439]</a> Also, four leaves
without borders, on each of which two portraits are printed, side by side.<a name="FNanchor_440_440" id="FNanchor_440_440"></a><a href="#Footnote_440_440" class="fnanchor">[440]</a></p>

<p>As for the borders, they appear again,&mdash;first, in the edition of Marot's
Psalms, published by Jean de Tournes in 1557, in octavo; and second,
with less impropriety, in the various editions, both in French and in
Italian, of Ovid's 'Metamorphoses,' issued by the same printer.</p>

<p>Jean de Tournes published also, in 1556, a small octavo volume of
specimens of his woodcuts, printed on one side only. This volume, which
is well known to collectors, and which may be found in the Cabinet
des Estampes, has on the first page these words alone: 'A Lion, Ian de
Tournes, <span class="smcapa">M.D.LVI.</span>'<a name="FNanchor_441_441" id="FNanchor_441_441"></a><a href="#Footnote_441_441" class="fnanchor">[441]</a> This page has a border of white arabesques on a black
ground, in which the Lorraine cross is perfectly visible, at the foot. There
are 22 engravings representing scenes from the theatre of the ancients.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span></p>

<p>The ninth bears the Lorraine cross. In the midst of this series, on leaf 21,
is a piece which does not belong to the series; it represents a dog lying
on a cushion.<a name="FNanchor_442_442" id="FNanchor_442_442"></a><a href="#Footnote_442_442" class="fnanchor">[442]</a> After this series come various engravings which we find
in Maurice de Seve's 'Saulsaye' (octavo, Lyon, 1547), in Ovid's 'Metamorphoses,'
and the 'Hymnes du Temps' of Guillaume Gueroult, which
were printed subsequently; then 11 plates bearing two figures facing
each other, taken from a work on Chiromancy and Physiognomy, by Indagine
(octavo, Lyon, 1549); 5 engravings from the edition of Petrarch
issued by the first Jean in 1545; and 9 small miscellaneous subjects.<a name="FNanchor_443_443" id="FNanchor_443_443"></a><a href="#Footnote_443_443" class="fnanchor">[443]</a>
The Cabinet des Estampes also contains one leaf of a folio specimen of
the woodcuts of the de Tournes, in which we find again the plates of the
Petrarch. It lacks, however, the Lac d'Amour, which is on folio 5 of
the collection we are describing, and is altogether in the manner of the
seven epitaphs published by Tory in 1530.<a name="FNanchor_444_444" id="FNanchor_444_444"></a><a href="#Footnote_444_444" class="fnanchor">[444]</a></p>

<p>I will not enumerate here the other books with engravings, of later
date, published by the second Jean de Tournes, because there is nothing
to justify me in attributing them to Tory's workshop; but one may conclude
from what I have said heretofore, that many engravings of the
printers of Lyon, hitherto attributed to Salomon Bernard, called Le Petit
Bernard, came from Tory's establishment. Indeed, we may well wish
that Le Petit Bernard might be relieved of the enormous mass of engravings
which have been attributed to him for lack of information concerning
them, but which render uncertain the attribution of those which
most certainly belong to him.<a name="FNanchor_445_445" id="FNanchor_445_445"></a><a href="#Footnote_445_445" class="fnanchor">[445]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span></p>

<p>Our list includes only engravings on wood; but I have no doubt that
Tory engraved also on metal, and not alone letters, which we should naturally
expect from Garamond's master, but plates as well. Now that the
eyes of collectors are about to be opened, I should not be surprised if some
one should discover one marked with his cross.<a name="FNanchor_446_446" id="FNanchor_446_446"></a><a href="#Footnote_446_446" class="fnanchor">[446]</a> To forward such discovery
I will insert the estimate of Tory's draughtsmanship formed by M.
Renouvier, who is so competent a judge of such matters.</p>

<p>'The plates of "Champ fleury," the first of which is dated 1526, have
an Italian after-taste, which manifests itself by the correctness of the figures,
and by their costumes; but the delicacy of expression, the fineness
of line, distinguish them clearly from the Venetian vignettes. The vignettes
of the Hours published between 1524 and 1543, varying in execution,
always delicate and with little shading, exhibit a degree of taste
which the Parmesan School sometimes achieves; but by the delicacy of
their execution they deserve the praise bestowed upon them by Dibdin.
Even if the figures are slightly confused in their attitudes and in their
draperies, or defective at some of the extremities, still, the spirited drawing
of the heads, and the arrangement of the scenes, amid charming architectural
designs, or in very restricted fields, show that our engravers
of vignettes lost nothing of their talent in passing from gothic to italic
letters, and, despite the name of the latter, it is certain that Italy never
produced any like them. Simplicity took the place of Gothic <i>goguenarderie</i>;
their expression is in the most refined French sentiment of the
period.<a name="FNanchor_447_447" id="FNanchor_447_447"></a><a href="#Footnote_447_447" class="fnanchor">[447]</a></p>

<p>'I seem to recognize Geofroy Tory's style in the "Tableau de Cèbes,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
published by Denis Janot and Gilles Corrozet in 1543, the vignettes of
which are often attributed to Jean Cousin. As for Tory's drawing, I
should recognize it through several layers of wood, by the delicately
drawn heads, the slender figures, the split extremities, to say nothing
of the floriated letters and the borders, in which the Italian grotesques
are mingled with natural vegetations, and in which he has often engraved
his name, his Pot Cassé and his mottoes. In Tory's vignettes there
are doubtless qualities that are more subtle than great, but they are our
qualities.'</p>

<p><span class="figleft150"><img src="images/i_b_265a.jpg" width="200" height="226" alt="" /></span>The inventor of the Pot Cassé was chosen
by his confrères, in preference to all other
engravers, to engrave their private marks.
They had realized the force of his 'kindly
exhortation to practice and employ themselves
in goodly inventions,'<a name="FNanchor_448_448" id="FNanchor_448_448"></a><a href="#Footnote_448_448" class="fnanchor">[448]</a> and had been
impressed by the perfection with which he
executed that species of engraving, which
he had completely transformed. For, in lieu
of the coarse vignettes with a black background,
on which the design stood out in
white, as if cut with a die, Tory had gradually introduced into these
woodcuts all the delicacy of the Italian engravings. The earliest ones of
his of which we have any knowledge are in the criblé style, which the
Middle Ages had handed down to him; but he soon rejected that style and
not only adopted a new manner of engraving, but altered the arrangement
of the designs that were entrusted to him. This fact is especially
manifest if we compare the original mark of the de Marnefs (Silvestre,
'Marques Typographiques' no. 151) with the one that bears the motto,
'Principivm ex fide, finis in charitate' (Silvestre, no. 1043). Instead
of the roughly drawn Pelican nourishing from its vitals its still more
roughly drawn young, in a nest perched on a tree of which the leaves are
larger than the trunk, we have, in the second engraving [given above],
an entirely new composition, of which both design and execution are
irreproachable. In the face of such results, we should not be surprised
by the predilection of the printer-booksellers for Tory; they deemed it a
duty to employ a confrère who poetized their profession: to them it
was a question of esprit de corps and of patriotism alike.</p>

<p>That is why we have so many typographical marks signed with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
Lorraine cross. We propose to enumerate all of those which we have
actually had before us. As it was impossible to arrange them chronologically,
we have adopted the alphabetical order.</p>

<p>B<span class="smcapa">ADE</span> (C<span class="smcapa">ONRAD</span>), printer and bookseller at Paris from 1546 to 1560,
when he withdrew to Geneva for religious reasons.&mdash;One mark, which
appears on the first edition of Théodore de Bèze's 'Poemata' (1548); the
volume contains also a portrait of the author signed with the double
cross. Conrad's mark, like that of his father, Josse Bade, represents a
printing-press. It contains also the words 'Prelum ascensianum'; but,
instead of being inscribed in a cartouche on the press, they are in two
cartouches, one at the top, the other at the bottom, of the border (Silvestre,
no. 867). When Conrad betook himself to Geneva, Eloi Gibier,<a name="FNanchor_449_449" id="FNanchor_449_449"></a><a href="#Footnote_449_449" class="fnanchor">[449]</a>
a printer of Orléans, bought the mark. It afterwards passed to Fabian
Hotot, a printer in the same city, who was using it in 1609; but before
using it he had the word 'Ascensianum' removed.</p>

<p>C<span class="smcapa">ALVARIN</span> (S<span class="smcapa">IMON</span>), printer-bookseller at Paris, from 1553 to 1593.
Two marks, representing a woman, seated, surrounded by the paraphernalia
of the arts and sciences, and holding in one hand a palm-tree decorated
with three wreaths. I have seen one of these marks, the larger, in
an edition of Rodolphe Agricola's book entitled: 'De Inventione dialectica
libri tres' (quarto, 1558), on the title-page of which is this imprint:
'Parisiis, ex officina Simonis Calvarini, in vico Belovaco, ad Virtutis insigne.'<a name="FNanchor_450_450" id="FNanchor_450_450"></a><a href="#Footnote_450_450" class="fnanchor">[450]</a>
The smaller one appears at the end of a book entitled: 'Conservation
de santé et prolongation de vie, etc., composé premierement par
noble homme H. [Hieronime] Monteux, conseiller et medecin ordinaire
du roi François II, et nouvellement traduit en nostre langue fraçoise
par maistre Claude de Valgelas, docteur medecin, etc. Paris, chez Simon
Calvarin, rue Saint-Jacques, à la Rose blanche couronnée, 1572.' This
is a 16mo, of which there is a copy in the Bibliothèque Nationale. This
Simon was, I have no doubt, a son of Prigent Calvarin, printer at Paris
from 1524 to 1582, whose mark is very different (Silvestre, no. 137).<a name="FNanchor_451_451" id="FNanchor_451_451"></a><a href="#Footnote_451_451" class="fnanchor">[451]</a> It
represents two persons holding a shield which hangs from a vine, with
these sentences surrounding them: 'Deum time,' 'Pauperes sustine,'
'Finem respice,' 'Prigent Calvarin.' Simon, having set up for himself
during his father's lifetime, had to adopt a different mark.</p>

whose marks 'au Temps' he used thereafter. He had a new one engraved
in Tory's establishment, with the same figure, but with a slightly
different motto: it reads: 'Virtus sola aciem retundit istam.' This mark
appears in the edition of the comedies of Terence printed in 1546. See
C<span class="smcapa">OLINES</span> (S<span class="smcapa">IMON DE</span>).</p>

<p>C<span class="smcapa">OLINES</span> (S<span class="smcapa">IMON DE</span>), printer-bookseller at Paris from 1520 to 1546.
Four marks at least. See the two already described in the preceding section,
under 1520-1521, as forming a part of title-pages, and numbers
80 and 329 of M. Silvestre's 'Marques typographiques.' The last two
passed in 1546 into the hands of Regnault Chaudière, a bookseller since
1516. Chaudière had married Colines's daughter by the widow of Henri
Estienne, and by virtue of the connection inherited his father-in-law's
printing-office and bookshop. He himself printed, in 1546-1547, under
the Latin name Calderius, an edition of the comedies of Terence<a name="FNanchor_452_452" id="FNanchor_452_452"></a><a href="#Footnote_452_452" class="fnanchor">[452]</a>; at
the end is M. Silvestre's no. 329, which (like no. 80) represents Time
armed with a scythe, and this devise in a scroll: 'Hanc aciem sola retundit
virtus.' Chaudière, who had previously used another mark (Silvestre,
no. 96), employed thenceforth this one with the figure of Time,
and handed it down to his successors.<a name="FNanchor_453_453" id="FNanchor_453_453"></a><a href="#Footnote_453_453" class="fnanchor">[453]</a> In 1548 he published an octavo
catalogue of his own books and those of Simon de Colines&mdash;'tum ab
Simone Colinæi, tum ab Calderio excusi.'<a name="FNanchor_454_454" id="FNanchor_454_454"></a><a href="#Footnote_454_454" class="fnanchor">[454]</a> The following is, in my opinion,
the order in which Simon de Colines's various marks were engraved
by Tory: In the first place, in 1520, the one with the rabbits, or <em>conils</em>,
which it has been said that Colines adopted as a play upon his own name;
but this conjecture seems to me the more improbable because these
same rabbits had been used on the sign of Henri Estienne's shop as early
as 1502.<a name="FNanchor_455_455" id="FNanchor_455_455"></a><a href="#Footnote_455_455" class="fnanchor">[455]</a> However that may be, Colines seems to have retained this mark<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
during all the time that he occupied Henri Estienne's house. When he
turned over that abode, in 1525, to Robert Estienne, who established
himself in business on the paternal premises, Colines went a little farther
down rue de Beauvais, and took for his sign the 'Soleil d'or,' which
appears on the second mark; finally, in 1528, he adopted the one with
the figure of Time, which was afterwards adopted by his son-in-law,
Regnault Chaudière.</p>

upon a heart ('cor'), and with 'Gilles Corrozet' at the foot (Silvestre, no.
145). This mark, which I have seen on a book of 1539,<a name="FNanchor_456_456" id="FNanchor_456_456"></a><a href="#Footnote_456_456" class="fnanchor">[456]</a> was undoubtedly
the first that Corrozet used. It descended to his heirs, and his grandson
Jean was still using it a century later, on the 'Trésor des histoires
de France,' the work of another Gilles Corrozet, which Jean reprinted
several times between 1622 and 1644. Jean simply removed from the
mark his grandfather's Christian name, regardless of the lack of symmetry
in the engraving caused by this subtraction. So that here was an
engraving that was in use more than a hundred years; it is an interesting
example of the durability of these woodcuts.</p>

bearing on his shoulders a woman plunging a sword in his throat. One
of the marks has the word 'odiosa' in the border on one side, and 'veritas'
on the other. Another is printed in an octavo volume of 1539 (Bibliothèque

<p>E<span class="smcapa">STIENNE</span> (R<span class="smcapa">OBERT</span>), printer-bookseller at Paris, from 1526 to 1550.
Six marks at least, representing the olive-tree in different forms. Three
of them are reproduced in M. Silvestre's work: nos. 162, 318,<a name="FNanchor_457_457" id="FNanchor_457_457"></a><a href="#Footnote_457_457" class="fnanchor">[457]</a> and 319<a name="FNanchor_458_458" id="FNanchor_458_458"></a><a href="#Footnote_458_458" class="fnanchor">[458]</a>;
add to these the large folio mark that appears on the Bible of 1528<a name="FNanchor_459_459" id="FNanchor_459_459"></a><a href="#Footnote_459_459" class="fnanchor">[459]</a> and
that of 1540, previously described; a small mark which appears in the
16mo Virgil of 1549; and, lastly, a mark similar to Silvestre's no. 163
(except that the figure is bald), which appears in 'Caroli Stephani de
Nutrimentis,' etc.<a name="FNanchor_460_460" id="FNanchor_460_460"></a><a href="#Footnote_460_460" class="fnanchor">[460]</a> Probably most of these marks were engraved for
Robert Estienne at the outset of his typographical career, that is to say,
about 1526; he carried them with him to Geneva in 1550; and his son,
the second Henri, used them in his turn, after his father's death, which
occurred in 1559. It was undoubtedly the widow of Tory who engraved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
the mark (in different sizes) which appears, after 1544, on the Greek
books printed with the royal types, and which represents a basilisk entwined

<p>E<span class="smcapa">STIENNE</span> (C<span class="smcapa">HARLES</span>), printer and bookseller at Paris from 1551 to
1561. Three marks at least. Upon entering the typographical profession
Charles adopted his brother's olive-tree; that is to say, he simply had
copies made of Robert's marks, as he succeeded to his business. I have
seen the first of these marks, similar to Silvestre's no. 163, in an octavo
edition of P. Bunel's 'Epîtres familières,' printed by Charles in 1551; the
second appears in a folio edition of Cicero, in four volumes, published
by the same printer from 1551 to 1555<a name="FNanchor_461_461" id="FNanchor_461_461"></a><a href="#Footnote_461_461" class="fnanchor">[461]</a>; and the third, like Silvestre's
no. 162, in the 'Petit Dictionnaire français-latin' (quarto), published by
Charles in 1559. It is probable that the second Robert used these same
marks after his uncle's retirement in 1561.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>F<span class="smcapa">EZANDAT</span> (M<span class="smcapa">ICHEL</span>), printer-bookseller at Paris from 1541 to 1553.
One mark (Silvestre, no. 423). This mark which, by way of allusion to
the name of its owner, represents a pheasant (<em>faisan</em>) on a dolphin, with
the letters M and F at the left and right, respectively, of the pheasant,
was used without the initials in 1549, as may be seen on the title of
'Le Temple du chasteté,' printed in that year by Fezandat, in octavo.<a name="FNanchor_462_462" id="FNanchor_462_462"></a><a href="#Footnote_462_462" class="fnanchor">[462]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span></p>

<p>In 1550, one Guillaume Alard (Fezandat's son-in-law, it may be), who
lived 'e regione collegii de la Mercy,' also used the mark in that form.<a name="FNanchor_463_463" id="FNanchor_463_463"></a><a href="#Footnote_463_463" class="fnanchor">[463]</a>
The appearance of this mark on Alard's book may be due solely to the
fact that the book in question was printed by Fezandat. I have been
unable to ascertain the facts because the fragment of the title-page on
which I saw the mark and Alard's name does not contain the title of
the book. The only possible clue is the three Greek verses on the other
side of the page, which lead one to think that it may have been a work
of Jean Blaccus Danois, of whom we have a translation of Isocrates into
Latin verses, printed by Regnault Chaudière, also in 1550 (quarto).<a name="FNanchor_464_464" id="FNanchor_464_464"></a><a href="#Footnote_464_464" class="fnanchor">[464]</a>
This G. Alard is not named by Lottin in his 'Catalogue des imprimeurs-libraires
de Paris.' I find the same mark in a small volume entitled
'Le Bouquet des fleurs de Sénèque'; octavo; Caen, 'de l'imprimerie de
Jacques le Bas, imprimeur du roy,' 1590.<a name="FNanchor_465_465" id="FNanchor_465_465"></a><a href="#Footnote_465_465" class="fnanchor">[465]</a> I find Fezandat's mark also in
a book published by the bookseller J. Dupuy in 1549: 'Novum Testamentum,'
in Greek and Latin; 16mo. Why? I have no idea.</p>

<p>G<span class="smcapa">IBIER</span> (E<span class="smcapa">LOI</span>), printer at Orléans. One mark, representing a printing-press.
This printer, whose oldest known imprint is dated 1559, had
evidently practised his trade several years earlier. This is what we find
concerning him in the 'Bibliothèque historique des auteurs orléanais,'
by Dom Gerou, which is preserved in manuscript in the Public Library
of Orléans: 'We may say that Eloy Gibier was in a certain sense the first
printer of Orléans; Mathieu Vivian and Pierre Asselin had preceded him,
but we know of only a single work printed by each of them, whereas there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
are a great number by Eloy Gibier. We do not know when he began,
but the earliest book printed by him of which we have any knowledge
is of 1559. At first he put no symbol on the title-pages of his works; the
place where the symbol should be was entirely unoccupied; later, he
sometimes inserted one, but not always. This symbol was a printing-press,
about which were the words: "In sudore vultus tui vesceris pane
tuo."' I have seen this mark on the 'Coutumes générales d'Orléans,'
printed by Gibier in 1570, octavo.<a name="FNanchor_466_466" id="FNanchor_466_466"></a><a href="#Footnote_466_466" class="fnanchor">[466]</a> But he afterward adopted the mark

<p>G<span class="smcapa">OURMONT</span> (G<span class="smcapa">ILLES DE</span>), printer-bookseller at Paris, from 1506 to
1530.&mdash;Three marks. The first, in the form of a border, is found on the
title-page of a volume containing nine comedies of Aristophanes, printed
by Pierre Vidoue, at Gilles de Gourmont's expense, in 1528 (quarto)<a name="FNanchor_467_467" id="FNanchor_467_467"></a><a href="#Footnote_467_467" class="fnanchor">[467]</a>:
a description of it will be found above.<a name="FNanchor_468_468" id="FNanchor_468_468"></a><a href="#Footnote_468_468" class="fnanchor">[468]</a> The second represents Fame:
it is a nude woman, winged, all over whose body are eyes, tongues, and
ears. At the foot, in a scroll, are the words: 'Ecqvis incvmbere famae'
('poterit' understood, no doubt). The Lorraine cross appears at the left
on the lower edge of the engraving. I have seen this mark on a small
book entitled: 'Alphabetum hebraicum,' consisting of 8 leaves, printed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
by Pierre Vidoue (Silvestre, no. 98). Although the name of Gourmont
nowhere appears in this case, I have no doubt that the mark belongs to
Gilles de Gourmont, for it is accompanied by his initials, E and G (Egidius
Gourmontius), at the left and right respectively; and we shall see
that this same mark was afterward used by Jérôme de Gourmont, Gilles's
son or nephew. It maybe that it was because of the loan of Gourmont's
Hebrew type that his mark appears on this precious pamphlet, a description
of which follows. First leaf, beginning at the end (according
to the Hebrew and Arabic custom), Gourmont's mark in a border of
detached compartments. On the verso Pierre Vidoue's epistle to the
reader, dated from his workshop August 1, 1531. Then comes the text,
followed by this subscript: 'Petrus Vidovæus Vernoliensis excudebat
Lutetiæ' And, lastly, Vidoue's mark&mdash;Fortune, with the words: 'Audentes
juvo' (Silvestre, no. 65). The third of Gilles de Gourmont's marks
signed with the Lorraine cross is given by M. Silvestre (no. 826). [This
mark forms the lower part of the border first described, and has evidently
been cut from the border for use separately.] It represents the
Gourmont arms<a name="FNanchor_469_469" id="FNanchor_469_469"></a><a href="#Footnote_469_469" class="fnanchor">[469]</a>: a shield coupé, three roses in chief and a crescent in

Gilles de Gourmont just described, but reversed. Beneath the inscription
'Ecqvis incvmbere famae,' in a small cartouche, are the initials H. D. G.
(Hierome de Gourmont), with the Lorraine cross just above. I have seen
this mark in an octavo volume published at Paris in 1534 by Jérôme de
Gourmont, under this title: 'Pauli Paradisi ... de modo legendi hebraice
dialogus,'<a name="FNanchor_471_471" id="FNanchor_471_471"></a><a href="#Footnote_471_471" class="fnanchor">[471]</a> and in another octavo, also published at Paris ('Dionysiæ') in
1535, under a Greek title of which the Latin translation is: 'Apollonius
Alexandrinus, de Constructione.'<a name="FNanchor_472_472" id="FNanchor_472_472"></a><a href="#Footnote_472_472" class="fnanchor">[472]</a> Jérôme de Gourmont published at
least one other book at 'Dionysiæ' in 1535; but I do not know the title, as
I have not seen the title-page. All that I can say is that Ausonius is quoted
in the Latin preface printed on the verso of the first leaf, of which I have
seen only a fragment, belonging to M. Silvestre.</p>

<p>I believe that Jérôme de Gourmont did some printing, although he
is named only as a bookseller in the bibliographies. The books that I
have mentioned show that he was a scholar who followed in the tracks
of Gilles de Gourmont. Indeed, the one first described, which is in Latin,
contains some Hebrew words; the second is entirely in Greek.</p>

<p>I have seen a little book, printed at Paris in 1539, with Jérôme de Gourmont's
mark: it is 'Pugna porcorum per J. Porcium,' octavo. The subscript
below the mark reads: 'Parisiis, apud Anthonium Bonnemere.'
Was Anthoine Bonnemere publisher for Jérôme de Gourmont, at the
same sign? That is something that I do not know.</p>

mark representing her sign, a golden sun in a starry sky. Below, two
lions erect, holding a shield on which are the initials C. G. This lady
carried on the printing trade for more than fifty years. She married first,
in 1502, Berthold Rembold, a partner of the first printer in Paris, Ulric<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
Gering. Berthold, who had established his domicile on rue Saint-Jacques,
'au Soleil d'Or,' having left Charlotte a widow in 1518, she carried on
the business alone until 1520, when she married Claude Chevallon, who
took up his abode on the same premises. Chevallon having departed
this life, in his turn, in 1542, Charlotte continued in the business until
1556. It was during her second widowhood that the mark in question,
which we reproduce herewith, was engraved. I have seen it on a quarto
volume entitled, 'Institutionum civilium libri quatuor, 1550. Parisiis,
apud Carolam Guillard, viduam Claudi Chevallonii, sub Soli aureo, et
Guilelmum Desbois, sub Cruce Alba, in via divi Jacobi.' Claude Chevallon
had upon his mark, by way of allusion to his name, two horses standing
(cheval-long). But M. Silvestre publishes as his (no. 395) a mark
which has the lions.</p>

his young. Tory engraved for them at least two marks: one which appears

by the device, 'In hoc signo vinces.' The Lorraine cross is barely
visible in the lowest ornament of the engraving. I have seen this mark
on the first page of a 'Missale ecclesie Parisiensis,' in folio, without date,
printed by Iolande Bonhomme, widow of the first Thielman Kerver,
as is shown by the presence of that printer's mark on the first page of
the text; it may be that there are copies in her name. This book is without
date, but should be placed between the years 1532 and 1552, which
embrace the incumbency of Jean du Bellay as Archbishop of Paris. Merlin's
mark is .095 of a millimetre high by .067 wide.<a name="FNanchor_484_484" id="FNanchor_484_484"></a><a href="#Footnote_484_484" class="fnanchor">[484]</a></p>

<p>N<span class="smcapa">YVERD</span> (G<span class="smcapa">UILLAUME</span>), printer and bookseller at Paris, from 1516.&mdash;One
mark, or, to speak more precisely, a small border in the style of
one of the marks of Simon de Colines. At the foot, in a scroll, are the
words, 'Nasci, laborare, mori.' This border appears in a small pamphlet,
undated, in pure gothic type, entitled, 'La Reformation des tavernes et
destruction de gourmandise, en forme de dialogue'; a small octavo of 4
leaves, of which M. Cigogne possesses the only known copy (1856). At
the end are the words, 'Paris, by Guillaume Nyverd, printer.' So that
Lottin is mistaken in saying that he was a bookseller only. He gives only
one date for his career in the trade&mdash;1516&mdash;but our engraving is certainly
later than 1520. M. Silvestre extends Nyverd's business career to
1559, on what grounds I do not know; but he also calls him a bookseller
only. The text of the 'Reformation des tavernes,' etc., was reprinted on
page 223 of the second volume of the 'Recueil des poésies françoises
des XV et XVI siècles,' collected and annotated by M. Anatole de Montaiglon.<a name="FNanchor_486_486" id="FNanchor_486_486"></a><a href="#Footnote_486_486" class="fnanchor">[486]</a></p>

<p>N<span class="smcapa">YVERD</span> (G<span class="smcapa">UILLAUME DE</span>), probably the son of the preceding, printer-bookseller
at Paris, from 1550 to 1580.&mdash;One mark, representing the
arms of France borne by two winged genii. Above them a head with
wings; from its mouth come two garlands in the style of those on the
last plate of 'Champ fleury.' At the left, at the foot of the cut, the letters
G. N., and at the right the Lorraine cross. This engraving, which is 8
centimetres wide by 11 high, was undoubtedly executed when Guillaume
de Nyverd was appointed king's printer, which title he held in
1561, according to Lottin. In all probability he held it earlier than that.
However that may be, I have seen this mark, already much worn, in an
impression of 1572: 'Prognostication touchant le mariage du tres honoré
et tres aimé Henry, par la grace de Dieu roy de Navarre, et de tres
illustre princesse Marguerite de France, calculée par maistre Bernard
Abbatia, docteur medecin et astrologue du tres chrestien roy de France'
[Charles IX]. There are in the Bibliothèque Nationale at least three editions
of the little pamphlet, made by the same printer at about the same
time, that is to say immediately after the marriage of the King of Navarre
with Marguerite de Valois. All three have this engraving on the
last page, but in every case it is accompanied by an addition of much
later date, namely, the device of Charles IX (two pillars joined by a scroll
containing the words, 'Pietate et Jvsticia'), above the arms of France.
The volume contains also numerous other engravings and letters bearing
Guillaume de Nyverd's initials. It is worth while to call attention to
the fact that de Nyverd does not assume the title of king's printer in this
book, although, as we have seen above, his appointment was of much
earlier date.</p>

Barbe was undoubtedly the daughter of François Regnault,

her initials, M. B., and did business in her own name until 1555. Barbe
Regnault's mark first appears, so far as my knowledge goes, in a small
octavo, printed about 1556, entitled, 'Description de la prinse de Calais

Michel Nostradamus,' 1558; J. Seve, 'Supplication aux rois,' ...
'de faire la paix entre eux,' 1559. In 1560 she published a book by Estienne

Indeed, I am inclined to think that Barbe did not adopt the 'Elephant'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
until after the death of Madeleine Boursette, François Regnault's widow,
about 1556. However that may be, La Caille says that Barbe Regnault's
mark passed into the hands of Thibault Bessault, then to his son Jean,
and finally to Antoine Houic. I have seen a book published by the last-named
in 1582, embellished with Barbe Regnault's 'Elephant.'</p>

<p>R<span class="smcapa">OBINOT</span> (G<span class="smcapa">ILLES</span> I), bookseller at Paris, from 1554 to 1575.&mdash;One
mark (Silvestre, no. 686), representing Icarus hurled into the sea
for not following the advice of Dædalus, his father, not to approach too
near the sun lest that luminary should melt the wax with which the
wings of our presumptuous youth were fastened to his body. In a scroll
are these words, 'Ne quid nimis.' This mark was used as late as 1619 by
Gilles Robinot the second, son of the first Gilles<a name="FNanchor_496_496" id="FNanchor_496_496"></a><a href="#Footnote_496_496" class="fnanchor">[496]</a>; it is .05 of a millimetre

<p>R<span class="smcapa">OIGNY</span> (J<span class="smcapa">EAN DE</span>), bookseller at Paris, from 1529 to 1562.&mdash;I
know two marks of de Roigny, signed with the Lorraine cross. The
older is the one that appears in a superb edition of Pliny's 'Letters,'
printed by Josse Bade in 1533, in folio (Silvestre, no. 674).<a name="FNanchor_498_498" id="FNanchor_498_498"></a><a href="#Footnote_498_498" class="fnanchor">[498]</a> It represents

the man's reads thus: 'Nec me labor iste gravabit'; and the woman's,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
'Spes premii solatium est laboris.' In the sky is Fortune with her wheel
and the horn of plenty, and this device in a scroll beneath: 'Quod differtur
non aufertur.' The second mark, which was adopted by Jean de
Roigny after the death of his father-in-law, Josse Bade, in 1535, is the
'Prelum ascensianum,' but reëngraved (Silvestre, no. 787); for Bade's
typographical plant passed into the hands of another son-in-law of his,
Michel de Vascosan, who continued to use his father-in-law's old woodcuts,
especially his mark, badly worn as it was. As for Robert Estienne,
Bade's third son-in-law, his father-in-law's death caused no change in
his typographical arrangements; he still retained the 'Olive-tree' which
he has made so celebrated.</p>

<p class="p6">NOTE CONCERNING GEOFROY TORY'S FAMILY.</p>


<p class="center"><strong>1.</strong> <em>Of his Forbears and Collateral Relations.</em></p>

<p><span class="figleft150"><img src="images/i_c_289.jpg" width="150" height="149" alt="G" /></span>ENEALOGICAL investigation, supplemented
with information furnished
by two learned Berrichons, enabled me
to enumerate, in my first work on Tory,
a considerable number of members of
his family, all, or almost all, of whom
lived in Faubourg Saint-Privé [Bourges].
The recent researches of my friend M.
Hippolyte Boyer, Deputy Archivist of
the Department of the Cher, make it possible
for me to make known his grandfather,
his father, and all his brothers and sisters.</p>

<p>'By deed of December 29, 1486, Robert Thory, husbandman, living
in the parish of Saint-Germain-du-Puy, conveys to Jean Thory, his brother,
for 20 livres tournois, his share in the heritage of the late Jean and
Jeanne, their father and mother.'</p>

<p>'By contracts of September 5 and 8, 1507, Jean Thory, of Saint-Privé,<a name="FNanchor_501_501" id="FNanchor_501_501"></a><a href="#Footnote_501_501" class="fnanchor">[501]</a>
and Philippe <em>Thoreye</em>, his wife, give their two daughters, Jehanne
Thorye and Perron Thorye, in marriage to Thevenin and François Leconte,
sons of Jean Leconte.' Among the provisions of Perron's contract
is one to the effect that Jean Thory and his wife settle a dowry of 40 livres
tournois on their daughter: 'and this in satisfaction of all claim upon
father and mother, be it in respect of furniture or of inheritance, which
said claim the said future bride, with the authority of her said future husband,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
hath renounced and doth by these presents renounce, in favour of
her father and mother, of <em>maistre Geoffroye</em>, André, Antoine and Michell
Thoris, children of said Jean and Philippe, save for the power to,' etc.<a name="FNanchor_502_502" id="FNanchor_502_502"></a><a href="#Footnote_502_502" class="fnanchor">[502]</a></p>

<p>Thus it appears that Geofroy was the oldest of the brothers and sisters,
as he is named first in the document. Now, as two of his sisters were
of marriageable age in 1507, and as he is called <i>maistre</i>, it is probable
that he himself was more than twenty-five. That is why I have placed
his birth about 1480.</p>


<p class="center"><strong>2.</strong> <em>Of his Descendants.</em></p>

<p>Jean Toubeau, printer and bookseller at Bourges, who died at Paris in
1685, while on a mission for his native place,<a name="FNanchor_503_503" id="FNanchor_503_503"></a><a href="#Footnote_503_503" class="fnanchor">[503]</a> wrote the following in the
preface to his 'Institutes consulaires,' printed by himself in 1682, three
years before his death: 'I have not been impelled to undertake and write
this work by the examples of the illustrious members of my profession.
Nor is it the example of those of my own family who have given their
works to the public: Geofroy Tory, professor in the University of Paris,
and a printer and bookseller in the same city, who was so prolific that,
proposing to put forth a book which should teach the scope and proportions
of those beautiful roman letters which we use to-day in printing, he
could not forbear to produce a book overflowing with learning, which
was followed by numerous others of instruction, which are so well
known that it is needless to give a list of them here, especially as M. de la
Thaumassière gives them a whole chapter in our history.'</p>

<p>It is evident from this passage that Toubeau was related to Tory, but it
is not clear how the relationship came about; and La Thaumassière does
not mention Tory in his 'Histoire du Berry,' printed a few years later by
François Toubeau, Jean's son, despite the promises which he seems to
have made to Jean, who had transferred to him the duty of making known
to posterity that illustrious son of his province.</p>

<p>The only author able to assist us at all in our investigations is Moréri,
who, in the article on Jean Toubeau in his great historical dictionary, says
that he was the great-great-grandson of Tory, on his mother's side. This
statement should be exact, and the article appears to be written from
information furnished by the Toubeau family; but all that we can determine
from it is that Toubeau was a descendant of Tory in the fourth
degree. Whether he descended from a son or daughter of Geofroy, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
have been unable to discover. To elucidate this fact, I wrote to M. Auguste
Toubeau, judge of the civil court at Bourges, and this was his reply, dated
March 5, 1856: 'I should have been glad to give you the information you
desire about Tory. But I have no documents or family papers which establish
his relationship to Jean and Hilaire Toubeau. I do not know what
connection there was between them and Tory, and I learned that there
was such a connection only from what Moréri says of it.'</p>

<p>Failing family papers, I made fruitless efforts to fix the relationship
between the Toubeaus and Tory. Finding it impossible to reach any certain
result, I have abandoned this search, which has no bearing upon the
history of our illustrious typographer. The Toubeaus alone are interested
in the solution of the question; I leave to them the task of proving
their kinship.</p>

<p>P<span class="smcapa">OSTSCRIPT.</span>&mdash;It may be surmised that Bonaventure <em>Torinus</em>, bookseller
of Bourges, who caused to be printed at that city, in 1595, by the
widow of Nicolas Levez, the 'Epitome juris civilis,' by an unknown author,
and 'Julii Pauli receptarum sententiarum libri V,'<a name="FNanchor_504_504" id="FNanchor_504_504"></a><a href="#Footnote_504_504" class="fnanchor">[504]</a> was Tory's son,
for he wrote his name in Latin in the same way that Tory wrote it; but
was it from a daughter of Tory or from a daughter of this Bonaventure
that Toubeau descended? It is impossible for me to say. The lateness of
the period at which Bonaventure makes his appearance leads me to believe
that he did not see the light until Tory had reached an advanced age.
Indeed, if we compare the dates, we shall find that this son of Tory cannot
have come into the world before 1530, for, starting from that year, he
would have been sixty-five years old in 1595, when his 'Epitome juris'
was printed, and there is no reason to believe that he died very soon thereafter.
For my own part, I believe that he was not born until after the publication
of 'Champ fleury,' and that his Christian name was an allusion to
his late birth.<a name="FNanchor_505_505" id="FNanchor_505_505"></a><a href="#Footnote_505_505" class="fnanchor">[505]</a> In that case, we can understand why he did not succeed to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
the paternal establishment: he was only two or three years old at Geofroy's
death&mdash;too young to think of taking his place; so that that duty fell
to Geofroy's pupils, whoever they may have been. As for Bonaventure,
the family traditions naturally led him back to Bourges, and the trade
that he adopted brought him still nearer to his father.</p>

<p class="center"><em>Remarks on the foregoing lines.</em></p>

<p>The numerous errors of all sorts which disfigure Palsgrave's book (a
very interesting book, none the less)&mdash;errors of which the foregoing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
lines afford several specimens&mdash;should have humbled to some extent
the national vanity of the author, who cries out incessantly, throughout
his bulky volume, against the ignorance of French printers. He should,
in any event, have remembered that English typography was the very
humble daughter of French typography, which latter not only trained
the first English artist (Caxton), but also gave him his two most illustrious
successors,&mdash;Wynkyn de Worde and Pinson,&mdash;the last named of
whom did in fact print a part of Palsgrave's book.</p>

<p>A modern Englishman, David Baker, has gone even farther than Palsgrave;
he says, speaking of Palsgrave's work: 'the French nation, so proud
to-day of the universality of its language, seems to owe it to England.'
To which M. Génin retorts: 'Baker reasons backward. The French language
did not come into universal use because it pleased Palsgrave to
write a grammar; on the contrary, Palsgrave composed his grammar because
the French language was already universal. This universality was
a fact, admitted before Palsgrave's birth,<a name="FNanchor_509_509" id="FNanchor_509_509"></a><a href="#Footnote_509_509" class="fnanchor">[509]</a> and others before him had tried
to draw up rules to facilitate the study of French by foreigners. Palsgrave
names three to whom he acknowledges that his work is greatly indebted.</p>

<p>'Leonard Coxe exults more modestly and with more propriety than
David Baker, for he seems to attribute to Geofroy Tory the honour of
having called forth Palsgrave's grammar. To be sure, a comparison of
dates seems to leave little likelihood to that conjecture, for the Frenchman's
work and the Englishman's are only about a year apart; but I
must notice here one curious fact which has not been noticed by the
bibliographers. On the title-page of the English book we find the date
1530, and on the last leaf, "Printing completed July 18, 1530." But the
king's licence to print, at the beginning of the volume, is dated, "At our
Castle of Ampthill, the second of September, in the year of our reign the
<span class="smcapa">XXII</span>." Now, as Henry VIII succeeded to the throne in 1509, after Easter,
the twenty-second year of his reign was the year 1531,<a name="FNanchor_510_510" id="FNanchor_510_510"></a><a href="#Footnote_510_510" class="fnanchor">[510]</a> and "Champ
fleury" appeared early in 1529. So that this gives us an interval of three
years.<a name="FNanchor_511_511" id="FNanchor_511_511"></a><a href="#Footnote_511_511" class="fnanchor">[511]</a> In this view Leonard Coxe's words have genuine force, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
point of concurrence which Palsgrave congratulates himself upon finding
in "Champ fleury" and "Lesclaircissement" may not be so fortuitous
as he chooses to state.'</p>

<p>However, as M. Génin goes on to say, 'this honour, claimed by the
English, of having been the first to write upon the French language, is,
all things considered, simply an act of homage to France; for if our
neighbours had awaited from a foreign nation the first book on the
English language, perhaps they would be awaiting it still.'</p>

in 1533 he was made the twenty-fifth bookseller to the University, by
command of King François I. Up to that time there had been only
twenty-four (see M. Didot's 'Essai,' col. 744), and they undoubtedly
went back to that consecrated number after the death of Tory, in whose
behalf an exception had been made.</p>

<p>About 1518, having joined the fraternity of booksellers, he went to
live on rue Saint-Jacques, opposite the Écu de Bâle, which was then used
as a sign by the famous printer Chrétien Wechel. The latter's establishment
was on the right going up rue Saint-Jacques, near the church of
Saint-Benoît.</p>

<p>About 1526 Tory established himself on the Petit-Pont, near Hôtel-Dieu,
but did not give up his shop on rue Saint-Jacques, at the sign of
the Pot Cassé.</p>

<p>Early in 1531, he changed his abode to rue de la Juiverie, the Halle

<span class="smcapa">OF THE APOSTROPHE, THE ACCENT, AND THE CEDILLA</span>.</p>

<p>M. Francis Wey, in a report made by him to the Philological section
of the Committee on the Language, History, and Arts of France, on
June 9, 1856, and published in the 9th fascicle of volume three of that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
Committee's 'Bulletin' (page 437), seems to attribute to Jean Salomon,
otherwise called Montflory, or Florimond, the first philological dissertation
in which there is any mention of the accent, the apostrophe and
the cedilla,&mdash;signs peculiar to the French language, which, as every
one knows, was for many years content with the alphabet of the Latin
tongue, from which it descended; more than that, he attributes to that
author the first use of these signs in a printed book. In both respects
the honour is due to Geofroy Tory. In truth, in his 'Champ fleury,'&mdash;which
was not published until 1529, it is true, although begun in 1523,
the license to print being dated September 5, 1526,&mdash;Tory proposed to
introduce the accent, the apostrophe, and the cedilla into the French
language; he did more than that; for, having become a printer, he was
the first to introduce those signs into typography. They appeared for
the first time in the last of the four editions of the 'Adolescence Clementine'
(by Clement Marot), all four of which he published. This fourth
edition appeared June 7, 1533, accompanied by an 'avis' in these words:
'With certain accents noted, to wit, on the <em>é</em> masculine, different from
the feminine,<a name="FNanchor_516_516" id="FNanchor_516_516"></a><a href="#Footnote_516_516" class="fnanchor">[516]</a> on letters joined by synalephe, and under the <i>c</i> when it is
pronounced like <em>s</em>, the which for lack of counsel has never been done in
the French language, albeit it was and is most essential.' This was the
first work in which Tory applied his orthographic system, as may be
seen by the inexperience of the compositors in his employ, who made
several errors of omission and transposition in this very notice.</p>

<p>This so necessary reform spread very rapidly, thanks to the fact that
the necessity had already made itself felt, as is proved by the work of Jean
Salomon, published in that same year 1533. But it is Tory's especial glory
that only those changes which were proposed by him were retained, save
a few orthographic signs which have no other purpose than to distinguish
words spelled alike but of different meanings&mdash;and these signs
were introduced later: a, à; ou, o&ugrave;; du, dû, etc.</p>

<p>With however good a will one might seek to deny Tory's precedence
in the use of orthographic signs in the French tongue, and to award it to
Jean Salomon, who used them in the same year, there are two facts that
decide the question in favour of the former: these are, the publication
in April, 1529, of his 'Champ fleury' (the first book of which is entitled,
'An exhortation to fix and ordain the French language by certain rules<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
for speaking with elegance in good sound French words'), and the formulation
of the 'General rules of orthography of the French language,'
no copy of which is known to exist, it is true, but for which Tory obtained
a license to print on September 28, 1529, four years before Salomon's
work appeared.</p>

<p>Nor must we lose sight of the fact that Tory was from Bourges, that is
to say, from the same province as Jacques Thiboust, Seigneur de Quantilly,
'friend of books, and distinguished penman,' who was Jean Salomon's
Mæcenas. There is nothing improbable in the supposition that
Thiboust had had his interest aroused by Tory, who is likely to have been
a crony of Thiboust in Paris by a two-fold claim,&mdash;as a Berrichon and as
a 'friend of books.' It seems to me that the alias 'Montflory' assumed by
Salomon is an allusion to 'Champ fleury.' That, in my opinion, is why he
wrote it 'Montflory' or 'Florimond,' indifferently, the word being an
anagram rather than a real surname.</p>

<p>As the opportunity offers itself, I will add to M. Francis Wey's notes a
few remarks which may some day assist in writing the biography of Jean
Salomon, of whom nothing is known except the fact, told us by himself,
that he was an Angevin.</p>

<p>We know now of three different editions of his work. The first, dated
1533, with no indication of the month, was printed in that year in three
pages and a half, octavo, under this title: 'Briefve doctrine pour deuement
escripre selon la propriete du langaige francoys.' We do not know where
or by whom it was published, but it certainly was printed at Paris, where
Salomon undoubtedly lived, and probably by Antoine Augereau, as was
the one next described, which seems to have been modelled upon it. Indeed,
like it, it is generally found between the same covers with an edition
of the 'Miroir de l'âme pécheresse' (of Marguerite of Navarre),&mdash;an edition
without date, name of place or of printer, which, therefore, should
also be attributed to Antoine Augereau and to the year 1533. This edition,
which M. Brunet does not mention,<a name="FNanchor_517_517" id="FNanchor_517_517"></a><a href="#Footnote_517_517" class="fnanchor">[517]</a> has on the first page: 'Le
Miroir de lame pecheresse, auquel elle recongnoit ses fautes et pechez,
aussi les graces et benefices a elle faictz par Jesuchrist son espoux.' It consists
of nine half sheets in octavo, printed as four (signatures <em>a</em> to <em>i</em>). On
the last leaf is a note to the reader wherein forgiveness is asked for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
first corrector (he who is called to-day 'the corrector of first proofs'), who
has inadvertently omitted three verses. 'Divers other trivial errors may
peradventure be found before or after, but they must needs be charged
rather to the variety of the copies than to the negligence of the correctors
or to the haste of the printers.'&mdash;As I have said, it is at the end of this
pamphlet that we find printed, with separate signatures of its own, from
<em>a</em> to <em>d</em>, the little book described by M. Wey after the copy in the Bibliothèque
Nationale which contains the 'Briefve doctrine.' But one essential
point, which M. Wey has forgotten to mention, is that in the first
edition not a word is said of the accent or the cedilla; there is no mention
of anything except the apostrophe.</p>

<p>The second edition, printed at Paris by Antoine Augereau, in December,
1533, at the back of another edition of the 'Miroir de l'âme pécheresse'
(called 'Miroir de tres chrestienne princesse Marguerite, reine de
Navare'), is two-thirds larger. It was probably published (like the preceding
one) by the Queen of Navarre's secretary, Jean Thiboust, after a
manuscript which the author had dedicated to him as his Mæcenas. Indeed,
we find at the head of this reprint the words 'ex manuscriptis authoris,'
which seems to indicate further that the author was dead. A point
worth noting is that the 'Briefve doctrine' again forms a part of an appendix
distinguished by separate signature letters (and folios) from Marguerite's
poem, and bearing the same title as in the earlier print, despite the
additions that had been made to it (presumably based upon Tory's publications),
especially with respect to the cedilla and the accent, which,
moreover, are used throughout the volume.</p>

<p>The third is the one which is still in manuscript at Bourges. It contains
several passages more than the preceding; but these passages,
which are of very debateable merit (as M. Wey, who reproduces them in
his report, declares), were probably added by one Jean Milon, of Arlenc
in Auvergne, calling himself a retainer ('serviteur') of Thiboust, who revised
the 'Briefve doctrine' about 1542; so much at least we may infer
from the date of some other pieces in the collection containing it, which
was presented, in 1555, by Jacques Thiboust to the Collège de Bourges,
whence it found its way to the public library of the same city. It is exceedingly
interesting to find this document in Geofroy Tory's native place.
It is as if chance had chosen thereby to remind us of the source of the
orthographic reform proposed by Jean Salomon.</p>

<p>To be entirely fair, we ought to say that certain other writers had even
anticipated Salomon. Thus Jacobus Silvius, otherwise called Jacques<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
Dubois, had published through Robert Estienne, on the 7th of the Ides
of January, 1531 (January 7, 1532, n. s.), a French grammar in Latin,
wherein he suggested a complete system of orthographic reform, including
the acute accent, the apostrophe, the cedilla, etc.; but his plan
was so complicated that it could not be followed in its entirety. Moreover,
the signs proposed by him were, for the most part, impossible of adoption
throughout a book. For instance, the cedilla consisted of an <i>s</i> placed about
the <em>c</em>. The merit of Tory's system, over and above its priority, was its
simplicity. So we may say that it was generally adopted after 1533.</p>

<p>François, by the grace of God King of the French, to the French nation,
greeting.<a name="FNanchor_519_519" id="FNanchor_519_519"></a><a href="#Footnote_519_519" class="fnanchor">[519]</a></p>

<p>We desire that it be known to one and all that our dearest wish is,
and has ever been, to accord to letters our support and especial favour,
and to do our utmost endeavours to supply the young with useful studies.
We are persuaded that such useful studies will produce in our realm
theologians who will teach the blessed doctrines of religion; magistrates
who will execute the laws, not with passion, but in a spirit of public
equity; and skilful administrators, the glory of the State, who will not
hesitate to sacrifice their private interests to love of the public weal.</p>

<p>Such are in effect the advantages which we are justified in anticipating
from worthy studies almost alone. And that is why we did, not
long since, make liberal allotments of stipends to distinguished scholars
that they might teach the young the languages and sciences, and train
them in the no less valuable practice of good morals. But we have considered
that there was still lacking, in order to hasten the onward march
of literature, something no less essential than public instruction, namely,
that a capable person should be specially entrusted with the matter of
printing in Greek, under our auspices and with due encouragement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
from us, in order to the correct printing of Greek authors for the use of
the young people of our realm.</p>

<p>In truth men distinguished in letters have represented to us that the
arts, history, morality, philosophy, and almost all other branches of
knowledge, flow from the Greek authors as streams flow from their
sources. We know likewise that, Greek being more difficult to print
than French and Latin, it is indispensable for the successful administration
of a printing establishment of this sort, that the director thereof
should be well versed in the Greek tongue, extremely painstaking, and
blessed with abundant means; that it may be that there is not a single
person among the printers of our realm who combines all these qualifications
(that is to say, knowledge of the Greek language, painstaking
energy and large wealth), but that in one the fortune is lacking, in another
the necessary knowledge, and in others still different conditions.
For those men who possess at once wealth and learning prefer to pursue
any other occupation rather than turn their hands to typography, which
demands a most toilsome life.</p>

<p>Accordingly we instructed several scholars whom we admit to our
table or to our intimacy, to point out to us a man overflowing with zeal
for the art of typography, and of proved learning and diligence, who,
supported by our generosity, should be employed to print Greek books.</p>

<p>And we have a two-fold motive in thus serving the cause of study.
Firstly, as we hold this realm from the All-powerful God, which realm
is abundantly supplied with wealth and with all the conveniences of life,
we choose that it shall yield to no other in respect to the profundity of
its studies, the favour accorded to men of letters, and the variety and
extent of the instruction provided; secondly, in order that the studious
youth, knowing our good-will toward them, and the honour which it
is our delight to bestow upon learning, may give themselves with the
greater ardour to the study of letters and of the sciences, and that men of
worth, incited by our example, may redouble their zeal and efforts to
train our youth to goodly and useful studies.</p>

<p>And even as we sought the person to whom we could with all confidence
entrust this function, Conrad Néobar presented himself most
opportunely, being most desirous to obtain some public employment
which should place him under our protection, and confer upon him personal
benefits proportioned to the importance of his service; and, acting
upon the testimony that has been laid before us of his learning and his
skill, by men of letters well known to us, it has pleased us to entrust to him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
the matter of Greek typography, to the end that he may print correctly
in our kingdom, supported by our munificence, those Greek manuscripts
which are the source of all learning.</p>

<p>But, desiring to provide at the same time for the public service, and
in order to forestall any possible fraud to the prejudice of Néobar our
printer, we establish him in his said office upon the following rules and
conditions:&mdash;</p>

<p>Firstly, we understand that all works not yet printed shall not be put
to press, still less published, before they have been submitted to the judgement
of our professors of the Académie of Paris who are charged with
the instruction of the young; so that the examination of works in profane
literature shall be entrusted to the professors of belles-lettres, and of those
on religious subjects to the professors of theology. By this means the
purity of our most sacred religion will be preserved from superstition
and heresy, and integrity of morals be removed beyond the reach of the
debasement and contagion of vice.</p>

<p>Secondly, Conrad Néobar will deposit in our library a copy of all editions
of Greek texts which he shall first put forth, to the end that, in the
event of some occurrence calamitous to letters, posterity will have this
source to draw upon to repair the loss of books.</p>

<p>Thirdly, all such books as Néobar may print shall contain an express
statement that he is our <em>printer for the Greek</em>, and that he is specially entrusted
with Greek printing under our auspices; to the end that not the
present age alone, but all posterity, may learn of the zeal and good-will
for letters whereby we are moved, and that, inspired by our example, it
may, like ourselves, prove itself disposed to strengthen the cause of study
and contribute to its progress.</p>

<p>Furthermore, inasmuch as this office is of more benefit to the State
than any other, and as it demands from the man who desires to perform
its duties zealously such assiduous care and attention that he can not have
a single moment to devote to labours which might lead him to honours
or to wealth, we have chosen to provide in three ways for the interest
and support of our printer Néobar.</p>

<p>Firstly, we award him an annual stipend of one hundred gold crowns,
called 'écus au soleil,' by way of encouragement and to indemnify him
in part for his expenses. It is our will, further, that he be exempt from all
imposts and that he enjoy the other privileges which we and our predecessors
have accorded the clergy and the Académie of Paris, so that he
may enjoy the greater advantage from the disposal of his books and that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
he may the more easily acquire all that is essential for a printing establishment.
Finally, we forbid everybody, printers and booksellers alike, to
print or to sell, in our realm, for the term of five years, such books in foreign
tongues, whether Latin or Greek, as Conrad Néobar shall have published
first, and for the term of two years such books as he shall have reprinted
more correctly, from ancient manuscripts, whether by his own
labours or by availing himself of the work of other scholars.</p>

<p>Whoever violates the terms hereof shall be punishable with a fine for
the use of the treasury, and shall reimburse our printer all the cost of his
editions. Furthermore, we command the provost of our city of Paris, or
his lieutenant, as well as all other magistrates now in office, or who hold
public employments from us, to see to it that Conrad Néobar, our printer,
enjoys to the full all the privileges and immunities hereby conferred
upon him, and to inflict severe punishment upon whoever shall cause
him annoyance or hindrance in the performance of his duties: for it is our
will that he be protected from the evil-disposed and from the malice of
the envious, to the end that the tranquillity and security of an unharrassed
life may enable him to devote himself with the greater zeal to his important
duties.</p>

<p>And that full and entire credence may be forever given to what is
hereinbefore commanded, we have confirmed it with our signature and
have caused our seal to be affixed. Adieu.</p>

<p>Given at Paris, the seventeenth day of January, in the year of grace
1538, and of our reign the twenty-fifth.</p>

<p>François, by the grace of God King of France, to all those who shall
see these letters, greeting. Be it known that we, having been well and duly
advised of the great skill and experience which our dear and well-beloved
Denis Janot has acquired in the art of printing and in the matters which
depend thereon, whereof he has ordinarily made great profession, and
even in the French language; and considering that we have already engaged
and constituted two printers of our own, one for the Latin, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
other for the Greek language; desiring to do no less honour to our own
than to the said two other languages, and to commit the printing thereof
to some person who is able to acquit himself thereof, as we hope that the
said Janot will prove himself well able to do, for these causes and others
moving us thereto, we have engaged and do by these presents engage him
to be our printer in the said French language, henceforward to print well
and duly, in good type and as correctly as may be, such books as are and
shall be written in said language, and such as he may be able to recover;
and to enjoy in that office the honours, authority, privileges, precedencies,
powers, liberties, and rights which may appertain thereto, so long as
it shall be our good pleasure. And in order to arouse in him the greater
ardour and to afford him better means and opportunity to maintain and
support the cost and outlays, the toil and labour which it will be incumbent
on him to make and undergo, as well in the printing and correcting
as in other matters depending thereon, we have decreed and ordered, do
decree and order, and it is our pleasure that the said Janot be given permission,
by these presents, to print all books composed in the said French
language which he may be able to recover, but only after they shall have
been well, duly, and sufficiently inspected and examined, and found to
be excellent and not scandalous.... Given at Paris the twelfth day of
April in the year of grace one thousand five hundred forty-three, and of
our reign the twenty-ninth.</p>

<p>A<span class="smcapa">MBROISE</span> D<span class="smcapa">IDOT</span> (son of F<span class="smcapa">IRMIN</span>) was appointed king's printer by
patent of December 7, 1829. The office became extinct in his hands in
July, 1830. M. Ambroise Firmin Didot, who thus closes the list of king's
printers, opened by Tory, has another bond of union with the latter: like
him he was an engraver. See what M. Firmin Didot père wrote on this
subject at the beginning of his tragedy, 'Annibal,' which was printed
by him in 1817, preceded by a letter from his son, who was then travelling
in Greece; the letter being printed in an 'English' type which he
tells us was engraved by his son Ambroise.<a name="FNanchor_536_536" id="FNanchor_536_536"></a><a href="#Footnote_536_536" class="fnanchor">[536]</a></p>

<p>There had long been functionaries known as 'libraires du roi' (king's
librarians), when François I instituted the office of king's printer. Indeed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
we find that Guillaume Eustace bore the title as early as 1574, that
is, under Louis XII. He is so styled in the subscript of an edition of 'Les
Chroniques de France,' in three volumes, folio. At the end of the last volume,
we read: 'Here endeth the third and last volume of the great chronicles
of France, printed at Paris in the year a thousand five hundred and
fourteen, the first day of October, for Guillaume Eustace, <em xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">libraire du Roy</em>,
and sworn binder to the University of Paris.'</p>

<p>In our first edition we expressed the opinion that Eustace may have
been replaced in 1522 by Jean de Sansay, who is described as king's librarian,
in 1530, in the accounts published by M. de Laborde.<a name="FNanchor_537_537" id="FNanchor_537_537"></a><a href="#Footnote_537_537" class="fnanchor">[537]</a> This is an
error. Eustace was still king's librarian in 1533. Jean de Sansay was not,
as Eustace was, <em>purveyor</em> to the king's library, but <em>keeper</em> thereof, a title
assumed in more exact terms by one of his successors, Jean Gosselin, in
a book which he caused to be printed in 1583.<a name="FNanchor_538_538" id="FNanchor_538_538"></a><a href="#Footnote_538_538" class="fnanchor">[538]</a></p>

<p>Jean de Sansay's immediate successor, under François I, seems to have
been Claude Chappuis, who was king's librarian before March 28, 1543,
as may be seen from the following document, dated January 6, 1544, new
style, the original of which is in the Joursauvault collection at the Bibliothèque
du Louvre:&mdash;</p>

<p>'In the presence of me, notary and secretary of the state to the King our
sire, Jehan Estienne,<a name="FNanchor_539_539" id="FNanchor_539_539"></a><a href="#Footnote_539_539" class="fnanchor">[539]</a> dealer in silversmithery to the queen, having power
of attorney from maistre Claude Chappuys, librarian to our said lord,
thereby sufficiently authorized, did by deed of the twenty-eighth day of
March a thousand five hundred forty-three, after Easter last past, executed
before Jehan Langlois, royal notary in the bailiwick or chatelany of
Moret, aver that he had had and received from maistre Jacques Bouchetel,
treasurer and paymaster of the household of our said lord, the sum of
two hundred forty livres tournois on account of his office of librarian during
the year beginning the first day of January a thousand five hundred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
forty-two [1543, n. s.], and ending the last day of December a thousand
five hundred forty-three. For which sum of <span class="smcapa">II</span>ᶜ <span class="smcapa">XL</span> livres tournois the said
Jehan Estienne, as attorney as aforesaid, hath held and doth hold himself
accountable and duly paid, and hath acquitted and doth acquit the said
maistre Jacques Bouchetel, treasurer as aforesaid, and all other persons.

<p>In 'La Renaissance des Arts,' M. de Laborde has published several
extracts from the royal accounts relative to this Claude Chappuis.</p>

<p>'To maistre Claude Chappuis, librarian to our said lord, the sum of
thirty-three livres five sols tournois, to him ordered to be paid by our said
lord, to reimburse him for several small sums by him furnished and paid
for the embellishment of books which our said lord hath caused to be
brought from Thurin, for the carriage thereof from Fontainebleau to
Paris and to Sainct-Germain-en-Laye, and from said Sainct-Germain to
Paris and Fontainebleau, and for expense incurred by said Chappuis, say
<span class="smcapa">XXXIII L. V. S.</span>'<a name="FNanchor_541_541" id="FNanchor_541_541"></a><a href="#Footnote_541_541" class="fnanchor">[541]</a></p>

<p>'To maistre Claude Chappuys, librarian to our said lord, the sum of six
times twenty and ten livres, and ten sols tournois to reimburse him for the
like sum which he hath paid of his own moneys to a bookseller of Paris
named Le Faucheux, for having, by command of our said lord, re-bound
and gilded divers books from his library, in the manner and guise of a
gospel heretofore bound and gilded by said Le Faucheux, written in letters
of gold and ink.'<a name="FNanchor_542_542" id="FNanchor_542_542"></a><a href="#Footnote_542_542" class="fnanchor">[542]</a></p>

<p>Doubtless this Claude Chappuis is the same man who belonged to the
household of Jean du Bellay, Ambassador to Rome in 1536. Having become
librarian to the King, he probably used in gilding the books mentioned
in the last quotation, the irons which François I had bought in
Venice, as we learn from another account, undated, but a little earlier,
preserved, like the others, in the national archives.</p>

<p>'To Loys Alleman, Fleurantin, for sending to Venice for irons to print<a name="FNanchor_543_543" id="FNanchor_543_543"></a><a href="#Footnote_543_543" class="fnanchor">[543]</a>
certain Italian books, and for the cost of such printing, the sum of V
livres.'</p>

<p>As for Le Faucheux, mentioned here as a binder, he is evidently Étinne<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>e
Roffet, called Le Faucheux, described as binder and librarian to the
King on the title-page of the 'Œuvres de Hugues Salel,' which he published,
and which was printed at Paris, in octavo, in 1540.<a name="FNanchor_544_544" id="FNanchor_544_544"></a><a href="#Footnote_544_544" class="fnanchor">[544]</a> He was the
son of Pierre Roffet (publisher to the two Marots, father and son), who
had for his sign a 'faucheur,' mower.<a name="FNanchor_545_545" id="FNanchor_545_545"></a><a href="#Footnote_545_545" class="fnanchor">[545]</a></p>

penitus egestum cum summa pernicie attingentium
custodire feruntur), continuo abstractum
servat, cathenis et compedibus captivum

genus potius cum huiusmodi et formicis et
grifis, quod et alii grifibus declinant, curiosam
et avaram illam singularis alicuius sibi habendi
cupiditatem exercere, quam cum hominibus
inhumanitatem, quod et melius forte dixerim
immunitatem, habere deberet. Non solum nobis

<p>Maiores nostros sua probitate contentos modum
suum ædificandi parva cum arte et elegantia
quondam exercuisse (viri singulari virtute
cumulatissimi) nemo est qui nesciat. Contenit
siquidem ipsa mediocritate, domos et habitacula
magno sine luxu et splendore construebant et
inhabitabant. Eo tandem est perventum, ut ingeniis
plusculum iam expergefactis fiant et adstruantur
ædificia passim non incelebria. Nempe
ab illo tempore quo magnanimus ille Rex, totius
Italiæ terror, Carolus Octavus, non sine magna
gloria victor Neapoli rediit, ars ipsa ædificandi
sane quamvenusta, Dorica et Ionica, item Italica,
totam hic apud Galliam exerceri cœpit bellissime.
Ambasiæ, Gallioni, Turoniæ, Blesis,
Parrhisiis et aliis centum nobilibus locis, publice
et private conspicua iam ædificia cernere
licet antiqualia. Licet, inquam, adeo nitida et ad
unguem exculpta dispicere multa, ut non modo
Italos, imo Dores et Iones, Italorum magistros,
ipsi Galli vincere videantur et iudicentur
manifestissime. Rebus huiusmodi et ingeniis
tam excellenter florentibus optimum esse duxi

est dignissimus qui tempestive iam pro claris
et melioribus ingeniis oblectandis et adiuvandis
in Gallia daretur impressioni. Dignissimus, inquam,
visus est mihi, et eo maxime, quod et libri
ipsi decem, quibus totum opus constat, per
capita sunt distincti. Ipsa capita vir bonis literis
eruditus Robertus Duræus Fortunatus, meus
apud suum collegium Plesseiacum Parrhisiis
quatuor annos quibus docebam olim primarius,
accurate et diligenter digessit, mihi exscribenda
non gravate dono dedit. Exscripsi opusque totum,
insuper elimavi, mendis quamplurimis defecavi,
succum textus in margine transcripsi,
chalcographo imprimendum dedi. Sinite, oro,

<p><i>Godofredus Torinus Bituricus Philiberto Baboo,
viro modestissimo, S. P. D.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>Itinerarium multis iam annis, vir ornatissime,
situ propemodum obsitum, quum ab
amico michi semper excolendo Christophoro
Longuolio, viro sine controversia studiorum
omnium bonorum excellentissimo, iam ab
hinc quatuor annos commodo primum exscribendum
accepissem, unum tibi manu mea
scriptum, forma quidem non usque quaque ineptum,
ad te ex Parrhisiis in Turoniam mittere
venerat in mentem. Viro cuius etiam nomini
lubens parco ad te dederam portandum;
verum ipse alii nescio cui, te, me, et sua fide
posthabitis, satis impudenter dono dedit. Labore
meo sic ego frustratus, alterum tibi conscribere
maturabam, nisi ipse Longuolius, qui
exemplar iam olim ex Morinis adportaverat,
et michi, ut dixi, commodo dederat, nuper ex
Pictavis Parrhisios adveniens, monuisset imprimendum
curarem. Curavi equidem, nominibus
opidorum seiunctim et seriatim coordinatis,
additis etiam suo loco plusculis aliter in
altero exemplari scriptis. Feci et indicem, quo
facillime quodcumque opidi et loci nomen in
toto opere disquiri possit. Mirabitur fortassis
aliquis ipsius operis stilum, interdum etiam
nonnullis in locis latinitatem. Stilum ipsum
satis laudabit studiosus; latinitatem vero antiquæ
illi ætati lector non malivolus condonabit.
Multa subemendassem Ptholomeo,
Strabone, Dionysio, Mela, Plinio, Solino et
authoribus aliis aliquot non omnino aspernandis
usus, sed et authori augusto reverentiam,
et exemplari admodum vetusto synceritatem
observans, nichil immutare volui, Longuolii
mei in aliud tempus studia vigilantissima, vel
alicujus Hermolai limam exactissimam expectans.
Unum est quod hic tangere non verebor,
authoris nomen in exemplari fuisse meo
judicio imperfectum (nam et Antoninus Augustus
inscribitur). Ab Hermolao, viro alioqui
nitido, Antoninus multis in locis apud suas
in Plinium castigationes allegatur. Viderint qui
legent. In textu exemplar ipsum secutus sum.
In inscriptione libri Hermolaum sum imitatus.
Laborem meum quantulumcumque tibi (ut debeo),
animo nequaquam ingrato, nuncupatim
dico. Suscipe, oro, qua fronte et optima quæque
soles, et permitte studiosissimorum quemque
per insignes mille urbes, te duce, cum hoc
itinerario venire. Vale, studiorum meorum succollator
humanissime.</p>

<p>Egregii quidam sunt felici hoc seculo pictores,
lector humanissime, qui suis lineamentis,
picturis et variis coloribus deos gentilitios et
homines, itemque alias res quascunque adeo
exacte depingunt, ut illis vox et anima deesse
tantummodo videatur; sed ecce, lector humanissime,
ego iam tibi illorum propemodum
more, domum offero, non solum suis lineamentis
et partibus elegantem et absolutam, sed
etiam pulchre loquentem et encomio sese particulatim
describentem. Offero etiam tibi septem
Epitaphia antiquo more et sermone veterrimo
conficta et conscripta, varios miserorum
hominum amantum affectus pervio quodam
modo ostendentia. Ipsa tibi (inquam) lubens
offero, non ut ita verbis obsitis loquaris aut
scribas, sed ut antiquitatem ipsam tibi ante oculos
tuos faciles et iucundissimos habeas, et te
a me benemonitum intelligas, ut in amoris insani
laqueos et angustias devenire caveas.
Vale.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_1_1" id="Footnote_1_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a><a name="Note_1" id="Note_1"></a> This term, which is wrongfully used in printing today
to denote all majuscules, was formerly employed only
for the initial letters of <em>chapters</em>. It was in this sense that
Schoeffer used it when he said, in 1457, that his Psalter
was <em>venustate capitalium distinctus</em> [distinguished by the
beauty of its capitals]; also Chevillier, when he wrote in
the <em>Origine de l'Imprimerie de Paris</em> (page 32), that the
books of the first printers of Paris had no 'capitals,' the
chapter initials being left blank, to be made by the illuminators.
M. Crapelet, taking the word in its present meaning,
concluded therefrom that the books of Gering and his
associates were without majuscules; and he thereupon attributes
the introduction of roman letters in Paris to Josse
Bade, in the sixteenth century, but he is altogether wrong.</p></div>

book, published in 1856; but the fact is that, thanks to
that publication, Tory is no longer in the same plight. His
books have become formidable rivals to those of Vostre,
Vérard, etc. One of his Books of Hours sold recently for
more than 3000 francs. [Note to 2d edition, 1865.]</p></div>

completed in 1488 (1489, new style), we read: '<em>Imprimee
par Maistre Pierre le Rouge, libraire et imprimeur
du Roy</em>'; but he assumed the latter title only once, and in
my opinion it was the result of a misapprehension. He
seems in fact to have been king's bookseller only; at all
events he assumes that title in the <cite>Heures à l'Usage de
Rome</cite>, which he published in 1491. In any case, his assumption
of the title does not prove that he received royal
letters patent, as all the other printers did, as we shall see
later.</p></div>

the orthography of proper names in the sixteenth century was very uncertain. As to the family
name especially, Geofroy's ancestors and descendants wrote it indifferently <em>Toury</em>, <em>Tory</em>, and
<em>Thory</em>; but Geofroy never varied: he always wrote <em>Tory</em> in French, <em>Torinus</em> in Latin (which
should, strictly speaking, be translated <em>Torin</em>). See further, on this subject, Appendix <a href="#AppNote_A">A.</a></p></div>

copied from the original monuments, which still existed at Rome in such great numbers, these
inscriptions were simply reproduced from one of the manuscript collections which were to be
found in the libraries and some of which were themselves very old. Mazochi's book had no
sooner been published than the errors which had found their way into it began to be pointed out
to the printer. He tried to correct them in a supplement which appeared in 1523, but his corrections
did not extend to all the inscriptions, which might still have been restored by reference
to the ancient monuments. A contemporary scholar, whose name is not known, undertook to
continue these corrections on his printed copy, and his emendations were transferred to three
other copies. These annotations impart great value to these four volumes in the eyes of epigraphists.</p></div>

Tory a character in his work; but what foundation is there, I ask, for attributing the character
of Raminagrobis to Tory? Simply the assertion of one of those seventeenth-century scribblers
of marginal notes who lived on the great authors of the sixteenth as rats live on the most valuable
manuscripts&mdash;by nibbling at them. What possible connection is there between Raminagrobis,
canon and poet, whom Rabelais represents as dying about 1546, and Tory, layman and prose
writer, who died twelve years earlier? Does it not remind one of the famous key to <cite>Astrée</cite>,
of which I had occasion to prove, in my monograph upon the d'Urfés, that not a word was
true? Almost the same course has been pursued with reference to the <cite>Satire Menippée</cite>, which

published by M. Villot, did not die until about 1528, if my reckoning is accurate. We can establish
the fact of his existence so late as 1522 by the documents published by M. de Laborde
in his book on the Renaissance. I once owned an original letter of Perreal, which shows him
in full vigour in 1511. That letter, which I presented to M. Alexandre Sirand, magistrate at
Bourg, has been published by him in his <cite>Courses Archéologiques</cite>, vol. iii, p. 5, in connection
with the church at Brou, in which Perreal was deeply interested. The letter I refer to is dated
November 15 (1511) and addressed to Margaret of Austria (widow of the Duke of Savoy),
to whom Perreal offers his services as superintendent of the work of building the church. That
princess accepted his offer, as we see by her reply of February, 1511 (1512 new style):
'Since Jehan Le Maire hath left us, we choose to have no other overseer in our edifices at Brou
than yourself.' (See the work last cited.)</p></div>

words of the same sound (<em>son</em>, for example, which has three totally different meanings, received
no accent), but it placed accents on words which had but one meaning,&mdash;<em>déjà</em>, for example;
of what use is the grave accent on the <em>a?</em> Moreover, it placed accents in certain cases on words
which in other cases have none. Thus it wrote '<em>votre</em> ami et le <em>nôtre</em>,' and '<em>notre</em> ami et le

Paris printer, Antoine Augereau, published a small treatise on the subject, entitled: <cite>Briefve doctrine
pour deuement escripre selon la proprieté du langaige françoys</cite>. ['Brief instructions for writing
the French language properly.'] This curious work, which is printed with the <cite>Miroir de très
chrestienne princesse Marguerite de France</cite>, in an octavo volume, 1533, informs us among other
things that the final E which requires the acute accent was at that time called <em>masculine</em>, and
that the word <em>feminine</em> was applied to it when it did not take the accent. These are, as we see,
the terms used by Tory. Hence doubtless the term <i>féminine</i>, which is still applied to-day, in
French poetry, to silent rhymes. (See Appendix <a href="#Page_295">V.</a>)</p></div>

several booksellers of that name at Rouen. One of them, indeed, Jean Mallard, had the Pot
Cassé for his sign in 1542. He was probably a brother of Olivier, who had authorized him to
adopt that symbol. (See <cite>Heures a l'usage de Rouen</cite>, octavo, gothic type, 1542.) I am indebted

Henri Estienne, Tory proposed to write with a cedilla the last <em>e</em> but one of the third person
plural of the perfect tense of verbs of the third conjugation (<em xml:lang="la" lang="la">emere</em>, <em xml:lang="it" lang="it">contendere</em>, etc.), to distinguish
it from the infinitive. In our day the circumflex accent has been adopted for this purpose;
but accented letters did not exist in Tory's time, and he sought to utilise, in the interest of the
metre, the only distinctive sign at the disposal of typography, the <em>e</em> with the cedilla, which was
then generally used for <em>æ</em>, in imitation of the manuscripts of the Middle Ages. Tory also proposed
to spell with <em>s</em>, instead of <em>x</em>, certain words like <em xml:lang="la" lang="la">mixtum</em>; 'for,' he said, '<em xml:lang="la" lang="la">misceo</em> has
<em xml:lang="la" lang="la">miscui</em> in the perfect; and so, by analogy, we must say <em xml:lang="la" lang="la">mistum</em>.'</p>

<p>I will not comment here on some other observations of the same sort made by Tory in this
same note to the reader; I will say simply that they all tend to prove his erudition and peremptorily
contradict the extraordinary assertion of a certain Abbé Joly, who, in a huge folio, entitled
<cite>Remarques critiques sur le Dictionnaire de Bayle</cite>, and published in 1740, observes that
Tory was 'very ignorant,' without adducing a single fact in support of his opinion. In the
<cite>Menagiana</cite> (vol. iv, p. 84 of the 12mo edition of 1729) Tory is rebuked, to be sure, for
forging Latin words, after the example of the author of the <cite>Songe du Poliphile</cite>; but this is a
less serious charge, and is not a proof of ignorance; on the contrary it proves misuse of knowledge.
Geofroy Tory, says the author, attracted by the style of the <cite>Poliphile</cite>, composed seven
epitaphs filled with words most worthy of a place in that work, 'such as <em xml:lang="la" lang="la">murmurillare</em>, <em xml:lang="la" lang="la">insatianter</em>,
<em xml:lang="la" lang="la">hilaranter</em>, <em xml:lang="la" lang="la">pederaptim</em>, <em xml:lang="la" lang="la">velocipediter</em>, <em xml:lang="la" lang="la">ægrimoniosius</em>, <em xml:lang="la" lang="la">avicipes</em>, <em xml:lang="la" lang="la">conspergitare</em>, <em xml:lang="la" lang="la">venustulentissus</em>,
<em xml:lang="la" lang="la">vinulentibibulus</em>, <em xml:lang="la" lang="la">apneumaticus</em>, and <em xml:lang="la" lang="la">collifrangibulum</em>, which he represented as
ancient words, and which the excellent Catherinot, in his epitaph of this same Tory, did not
fail to guarantee to be such.'&mdash;See what Catherinot has to say of Tory's <cite>Epitaphs</cite> in his epitaph
of Tory, p. 44 supra. [<em xml:lang="la" lang="la">Tumulos aliquot ludicros veterrimo stylo latine condiderit.</em>]</p></div>

book, extends the author's rights for four years, not for two. The discrepancy may be
explained by the fact that the <cite>Ædiloquium</cite> was printed while Tory's application for the license
was pending,&mdash;that is to say, in the first three months of 1531, which were then reckoned in
the year 1530, according to the old computation. In fact, the license is dated June 18, 1531,
which seems to conflict with the date of printing of the <cite>Ædiloquium</cite>. This circumstance also
explains why the second title of the book is different in the printed volume from that given in
the license (<cite>Erotica</cite>). See p. <a href="#Page_31">31</a>, supra.</p></div>

only 60 francs in 1785. It was the same copy, apparently, which was sold for 13 pounds at

altogether modern. The first engravers signed almost nothing; it was not until the sixteenth century
that they marked their works with special emblems, and even then it was not so much with
the object of assuring themselves a monopoly in them, as with that of making themselves known
to persons who might require their services for other works. Little by little this species of advertisement
became an effective muniment of title,&mdash;in the natural order of things. It was the
same with works of the mind. Not until quite a late period were scholars and other men of letters
able to derive any profit from their works. In the early days of printing, even, a printer who
proposed to reprint a book did not consider himself bound to obtain the author's consent. From
the moment that he made his book public, it was regarded as a treasure belonging to society at
large.</p></div>

the Connétable de Montmorency: 'I am obliged to confess that we lost the stag, and Perot has
buried himself; he dares not show himself in my presence.' M. Génin, who published this
letter among the <em>pièces justificatives</em> of his edition of the <cite>Lettres de la Reine de Navarre</cite> (8vo,
Paris, 1841; p. 468), says in a note to the name Perot that he was a dog. I should probably
have made the same mistake, had I not, even before I saw this miniature, made the acquaintance
of the huntsman in question upon reading the accounts of the expenditure of François I, the
lists of his household, and the rolls of receipts given to his treasurer. I find, for example, under
date of July 12, 1531: 'Due to Perot de Ruthie, in payment of such emoluments and privileges
as he has by virtue of his office of keeper of the park and castle of Saincte Jame, and of
the forests and four ponds of Raiz.' Five years later, I find this entry: 'To Perot de Ruthie, to
be used for the necessary expenses of sending for and causing to be brought to him a part of the
dogs, with their whippers-in, from his kennels in the forest of Chenonces.' (Roll of Receipts
for 1536). Still later, he became lieutenant of venery and gentleman of the chamber. He was

(folio 185) with a title-page printed in red, in these words: 'Die dominica ad vesperas. Psalmus.'
The engraving in question is below them. The last page of <em>Bb</em> ends with the word
'finis,' which proves that the book had but 25 signatures.</p></div>

of the Department of Engravings, was of the opposite opinion. According to him the unsigned
engravings were copies of the others. It seems to me that the dates of printing confirm my theory.
For we find the unsigned engravings in an edition of 1522; so that we must refer those
with the cross to an earlier date; but this seems hardly probable, since Louis Royer (to whom
they are attributed, as we shall see, because he was the first to use them) succeeded Jean de Brie,
who did not die until about 1522.</p></div>

Durand tells us that he wrote them in 1583, without spectacles, notwithstanding his great age

at Besançon in 1807 (2 vols., octavo), attributes to Salomon Bernard, whose period of activity
he places between 1550 and 1580 (vol. i, p. 63 ), the engravings of Petrarch's <cite>Triumphs</cite>,
which appear in an edition of 1545, and a <cite>Resurrection of the Dead</cite>, dated 1547 (vol. i, p.
64), which dates are inconsistent with those mentioned above; he also attributes to him (vol.
i, p. 65) the theatrical scenes which we have with good reason ascribed to Tory, whose cross
appears on one of them; and, lastly, he attributes to him the story of Psyche, in 32 duodecimo
cuts, and the medallions of Jacques Strada's <cite>Epitome des Antiquités</cite> (Lyon, 1553), his authorship
of which is very doubtful. But there is no question at all concerning the following pieces,

about 1580, because of his religion, is the following note: 'The figures that we offer you
here are from the hand of an excellent craftsman, known in his day under the name of Salomon
Bernard, called Le Petit Bernard, and have always been held in esteem by those who are learned
in works of this sort.'

what I have said on this subject in my book on the <cite>Origin of Printing</cite>, vol. i, p. 210, and
vol. ii, p. 89.) The Gourmonts of Paris were in fact descended from a noble family of the
Cotentin, which may still be in existence, and which bore the same arms in the seventeenth
century. Gilles de Gourmont had taken up his abode in Paris in the last years of the fifteenth
century, as had several of his brothers, who practised the same trade. The oldest, Robert, appears
in that city as early as 1498; Jean, who was younger than Gilles, not until 1507. We
hear also of a Jérôme and a Benoît as booksellers in Paris in the middle of the sixteenth century.
I do not know what their relationship to the earlier men was. Perhaps they were sons of Robert.
(Benoît, who married Catherine Goulard, had a son baptized by the name of Gilles at the
church of Sainte-Croix-en-la-Cité, on October 9, 1546.) We also find a Jean Théobald de
Gourmont at Antwerp in 1527. As for Gilles, he was engaged in bookselling and printing from
1506 to about 1533, and left two sons, Jean and François, who retained his establishment on
rue Saint-Jean-de-Latran, and printed there, in 1587, the <em>Tableaux des Arts Libéraux de Christophe
de Savigny</em>. This is an in-plano, at the beginning of which is a superb engraving representing
the arms of the family [as described in the text]. This remarkable work, which bears
the monogram of the two brothers, was probably executed by Jean, the elder, who was a
painter and engraver. The Musée du Louvre has a picture supposed to be by him (<em>Notice des
tableaux du Louvre</em>, part 3, p. 156); he is the author of a fine portrait of the Cardinal de
Bourbon, mentioned by Mariette and now in the Cabinet des Estampes; he is mentioned also
by Abbé de Marolles and by Papillon for certain pictures of equestrian groups and bits of decoration.
His mark (formed of the letters I D G entwined) and the name accompanying it are
found on several pieces cited by Brulliot, on the plates of a Bible of 1560, and on certain pieces
of Tortorel and Perissim (Renouvier, <em>Maîtres Graveurs du Seizième Siècle</em>, p. 195 ). It will
be seen that Gilles had worthy successors; unfortunately the race of the Gourmonts of Paris
died out with them.</p></div>

us that this Jean Thory lived on rue aux Vaches, in Faubourg Saint-Privé; so that it was
on that street that Geofroy was born. 'Now,' M. Boyer writes me, 'as that street contains only
two houses, I am inclined to select as the house in question the one designated by the name
of <i>maison du perron</i>, because of a stoop (<em>perron</em>) with a wooden roof which is still preserved,
and which is accounted for by the proximity of the river.' I saw the house in 1856; it still belongs
to the Toubeau family, which tends to confirm M. Boyer's opinion.</p></div>

The first alone contains a license to print (dated August 29, 1595). Therein the publisher is
called, in French, 'Thorin,' the natural rendering of the Latin name that we find in the 'note
to the reader,' where the form 'Torinus' occurs four times, and 'Thorinus' once only; which
confirms my hypothesis relative to the descent of this bookseller of Bourges. For we have seen
that Tory wrote his name Torinus in Latin. I must not omit to mention one objection suggested
by a friend of mine at Bourges,&mdash;that our man is called Bonaventure <i>Thorin</i>, in a book
of imposts for the year 1588. But every one knows how irregular the spelling of names was in
the old days.</p></div>

the following letter, of which I found a copy in the Bibliothèque du Louvre, in the Nyon collection.
</p>
<p>
'When I asked and obtained the office of king's printer, of which M. Le Breton had been
deprived by death, I had no idea that it could cause any heart-burning on the part of my confrères,
with whom I have always earnestly desired to be on the best of terms. If I had been able
to foresee such a thing, I am too much a friend of peace to have voluntarily exposed myself to
it by assuming a title which was subject to dispute. But, monsieur, when I submitted the question
to you, I thought that I could see that it did not seem to you free from doubt. For this
reason I cannot hesitate to abandon claims which seem to me well-founded.
</p>
<p>
'I beg you therefore, monsieur, to regard as not having been made the claims that I put
forward on this subject, and as my confrères do not pretend that any one of them has the
right to style himself first king's printer, in like manner I agree to assume simply the title of ordinary
printer to his Majesty, and that we shall be placed in the <em>Almanack Royal</em> in the order
of our reception.</p>

century; but the office was neither regularly instituted nor general in its scope. These printers
seem to have had it specially in charge to print official documents in the provinces, which function
conferred on them certain privileges, and sometimes caused difficulties with the local authorities,
who also had their special printers. The first editions of the edicts, ordinances, etc.,
emanating from the central authority were afterwards placed in the hands of the royal printing-office
in Paris. See what I have to say on this subject in my work on <em>Les Estienne</em>, p. 56.

In 1844 M. Le Roux de Lincy published in the <em>Journal de l'Amateur de livres</em>, and also
had printed separately in an octavo pamphlet of 16 leaves, a compilation entitled: <em xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Catalogue
chronologique des imprimeurs et libraires du roi, par le père Adry</em>; but those shapeless memoranda
were not originally intended for printing, and I have been unable to obtain the slightest
particle of useful information from them.</p></div>

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org/license

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than

copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with

If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
